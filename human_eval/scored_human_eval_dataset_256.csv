"Photo via Instagram Justin Bieber may currently be in hot water over his hairstyle, but if there's one thing he'll always get a pass on it's his talent. And fortunately over Instagram he displayed a minor miraclein playing a piano cover of Drake's ""Hotline Bling"" and more importantly, Rihanna's ""Work"" without, get this, not fucking it up. Over the course of barely a month, the ugly side of the internet has shown white males, females, human beings who shouldnt be of this earth covering the beautiful riddims of the Rihanna and Drake assisted single only to fail miserably as musicians. However, young Bieber eases into the keys for each song beautifully and learns that if you can't replicate patois properly it's best to become mute. We're ALMOST willing to forgive the dreadlocks because we're certain it was Post Malone's fault anyways. Watch the videos here and here or below.

"Stand Up and Speak . Los Angeles-based producers Jerome LOL and Samo Sound Boy are gearing up to release their second full-length EP as DJDS, titled Stand Up and Speak, on January 29. But today, the duo have decided to share that skyscraping collection of retro-house riffs and reconstructions in full over at the website of their preeminent local radio station, KCRW. The whole record's streaming over a week in advance, and it largely follows on the promise of the ambitiously tweaked tracks they've released from the album so far (and with the string of giddy edits of pop songs they've issued in parallel), distilling the very essences of joy and light into dense dancefloor excursions.

"June 7 - Hong Kong shares rose over 1 percent on Tuesday after U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Janet Yellen gave a largely upbeat assessment on the U.S. economic outlook, but gave few hints on when it will increase interest rates. To some investors, the absence of a time frame in Yellen’s remarks on Monday suggested that the Fed may now be in no rush to raise rates after a surprisingly weak job report last week. That contrasts sharply with comments by many Fed officials in May, which put the prospect of a rate rise firmly on the table as early as this month or next. The Hang Seng index rose 1.4 percent to 21,328.24 points, while the China Enterprises Index gained 1.6 percent to 9,004.30 points. Hong Kong-listed shares of HSBC rose 1.7 percent on news that the bank will restructure its global banking division to cut costs and make the business more “agile”.

"WASHINGTON — President Trump confirmed on Monday that his administration would not immediately pursue a proposal to raise the age limit for buying an assault rifle, going back on earlier pledges that he made after last month’s deadly mass shooting at a South Florida high school. In a Twitter post, Mr. Trump said there was “not much political support (to put it mildly).” In the pair of tweets, the president said the White House fully backs strengthening background checks and banning the use of bump stocks, which can turn a semiautomatic weapon into an automatic one. The White House also will move forward with its controversial plan to arm trained teachers with concealed firearms. In the wake of the Feb. 14 shooting that killed 17 people at a high school in Parkland, Florida, Mr. Trump had initially said he would pursue raising the age limit to purchase assault rifles to 21 from 18. But after a meeting with the powerful National Rifle Association, Mr. Trump appeared to back down from that proposal, raising questions about the influence of the N.R.A.",Trump Says He Will Not Immediately Raise Assault Rifle Age,Trump Says He Will Not Immediately Pursue Assault Rifle Bill,Trump: 'Not much political support' for bump stocks,9,9,4,9,7,6,9,9,9
