" (CNN)The House Intelligence Committee voted unanimously Monday evening to make public the Democratic memo rebutting GOP allegations that the FBI abused surveillance laws, the committee's top Democrat said, a move that will put the issue back on President Donald Trump's desk this week. The classified memo from Rep. Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House Intelligence Committee, is written to push back against the central allegations of the Republican memo from Intelligence Chairman Devin Nunes. Nunes' memo was released Friday and alleges the FBI abused the FISA process in obtaining a surveillance warrant on former Trump campaign foreign policy adviser Carter Page. Schiff told reporters Monday evening that the committee also agreed to send the Democratic memo to the FBI and Justice Department to play a role in the Executive Branch approval process. Schiff and other Democrats charge that Nunes' memo is inaccurate and misleading, and the 10-page Schiff memo goes point-by-point to counter the charges in the Nunes memo. Schiff has said he has given his memo to the Justice Department for review. RELATED: Read the disputed memo here The GOP-led House Intelligence Committee blocked the release of the Democratic memo at last week's committee meeting, saying members had just been presented with the document, instead moving forward with the four-page Nunes memo that now has been declassified after Trump agreed to its release Friday.  The panel did, however, agree last week to let the full House review the Schiff memo in a classified setting. Republicans leaving the closed-door meeting on Monday said they support its release, which is now in the hands of the White House. The process for publicly releasing the Schiff memo is the same as the Nunes document: The President will have five days to decide whether to allow the document to be made public or object to its release. If the President objects, the House Intelligence Committee could send the matter to the full House to debate in closed session and vote on whether to make the memo public. Following Monday's vote, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the administration will follow the same procedure for reviewing the Schiff memo as it did the Nunes one last week. But she stopped short of saying the White House would declassify the new memo. The classified memo is expected to be taken by courier to the White House Monday evening, the official said, setting into motion the five-day review period. The official did not say whether the decision would be made before Friday, but suggested it could be. One Florida Republican who is helping run the Russia investigation, Rep. Tom Rooney, said he though there wouldn't be much in the Schiff memo to redact. Schiff told reporters he thought that Republicans felt they had to vote to release the Democratic memo after blocking it last week -- adding that he thought it would also be very difficult for the White House to object to its release. But Schiff said he's concerned the White House will make ""political redactions"" to the memo before releasing it, and not just to protect sensitive information, and that's why he asked the Justice Department and FBI to play a role vetting the document. Schiff says they have already provided the memo to DOJ and FBI, but have not gotten a response yet. Monday's meeting also renewed the committee's fight over the role that the White House played with the Nunes memo, which Trump said ""vindicates"" him on Sunday. Rep. Mike Quigley, an Illinois Democrat, pressed Nunes during the meeting on whether he had coordinated with the White House in any aspect of the memo, just as he had one week prior when Nunes did not respond to his questions about staff involvement with the White House on the memo. Nunes read a statement at the meeting saying that the White House was not involved with the ""drafting"" of the Republican memo. But that did not satisfy Democrats, as Schiff said it was a ""lawyerly"" response that does not address whether the White House coordinated in other ways surrounding the creation of the memo. Trump tweeted about both Schiff and Nunes on Monday morning, slamming the top Democrat on the Intelligence Committee and praising the Republican chairman, although he didn't address Schiff's memo specifically. ""Little Adam Schiff, who is desperate to run for higher office, is one of the biggest liars and leakers in Washington, right up there with Comey, Warner, Brennan and Clapper! Adam leaves closed committee hearings to illegally leak confidential information. Must be stopped!"" Trump tweeted. ""Representative Devin Nunes, a man of tremendous courage and grit, may someday be recognized as a Great American Hero for what he has exposed and what he has had to endure!"" he tweeted two hours later. Schiff responded to Trump with a tweet of his own. ""Mr. President, I see you've had a busy morning of 'Executive Time.' Instead of tweeting false smears, the American people would appreciate it if you turned off the TV and helped solve the funding crisis, protected Dreamers or...really anything else,"" he tweeted.

"Tech We’re Using How do New York Times journalists use technology in their jobs and in their personal lives? The Times’s bureau chief in Beijing discussed the tech she is using. As Beijing bureau chief, what is it like to try to get information online given China’s Great Firewall, the system of filters and controls that can limit what people see on the internet there? We live and die by the strength of virtual private networks, or VPNs. The Chinese government is always trying to disrupt VPNs. Some work relatively well for a few months, then all of a sudden they slow down, a sign that the government has successfully interfered with them. As journalists, we feel frustrated by the instability of the internet, the overall slowness. But we are not the only ones affected. Businesses operating in China have the same problems. So do researchers, scholars and scientists, all people who need to get information from websites — including Twitter, Facebook and Google — that the government blocks. What story was your greatest challenge working with these restrictions? All stories are a challenge. Everything. That’s the point — the Great Firewall blocks so much. The internet always slows to a crawl during Communist Party congresses, when the government believes it must keep everything controlled and calm. We are expecting the internet to be particularly slow this fall when the party holds a major meeting to re-elect President Xi Jinping as leader. What tools do you use to overcome the Great Firewall? What could be better about the tools, if anything? I would like to see faster, more efficient VPNs that are not so vulnerable to Chinese hackers, who are world champions. Is government surveillance a concern for you? If so, how do you keep your work and communications private? Surveillance in China is all-encompassing. There is no foolproof way to elude it. We are just reporters and we don’t have anything to hide. There are CCTV cameras everywhere. We do take steps to protect our sources. The Chinese were way ahead of Americans in adopting messaging apps like WhatsApp and WeChat. What messaging app do you use the most? I use both WeChat and WhatsApp, though not a lot. By not using WeChat too much, I deny the prying eyes of the government the pleasure of knowing instantly whom I am talking to. But I do not try to hide anything. That’s impossible. Last month, I was in the provinces and when I started to talk to someone on WhatsApp, I was immediately disconnected. Beyond your job, what tech product are you currently obsessed with using in your daily life and why? Air Matters is a vital app for checking pollution levels. I can tell in the morning from my apartment in a high-rise building what the air is like. My measure is whether I can see the beautiful Beijing hills in the distance. On clear days, they stand out as a jagged ridge of blue. On bad days, you can’t see them. Today the A.Q.I. (air quality index) in Beijing is 188, or moderately polluted. On Air Matters you can see the A.Q.I. in other Chinese cities — most are over 100 today. And you can see the worst polluted place in the world. Today it is a city in the west of China, Aksu, with a level of 900 because of a sandstorm. I am glad I am not there. What Chinese online service or app do you use that Americans may not know about and why do you like it? I like Didi, the ride-hailing service. It’s better than Uber. You can get an ordinary Beijing taxicab with a pleasantly cranky driver, grungy interior and an ultracheap fare. Or you can go high end, and get a Didi driver who comes in a spiffy car with a clean interior and bottled water. video",How Do You Use Technology in Your Jobs?,China’s Great Firewall Blocks Information,The Times’s Beijing Chief Discusses Technology,10,10,10,4,6,10,8,6,10
"The radio journalist Amy Goodman spent the weekend with the threat of a riot charge hanging over her, arising from protests over a planned oil pipeline in North Dakota. But on Monday a judge rejected the case for lack of evidence. Ms. Goodman, the host and executive producer of the syndicated radio, television and web show “Democracy Now!” on Pacifica Radio, had planned to enter a not guilty plea on Monday, but District Judge John Grinsteiner declined to sign the charging document, bringing the case to a stop — at least for now. She and her lawyers declared victory on Monday, but Ladd Erickson, a state prosecutor who is assisting the Morton County state’s attorney’s office in the case, said other charges were possible. “I believe they want to keep the investigation open and see if there is any evidence in the unedited and unpublished videos that we could better detail in an affidavit for the judge,” he said via email. “The Democracy Now video that many people have seen doesn’t have much evidence value in it.” Mr. Erickson had informed the broadcaster of the planned riot charge. Ms. Goodman had characterized that as a threat to journalism and the First Amendment. Appearing in a Facebook Live video from outside the courthouse in Mandan, N.D., on Monday after it became clear she would not face the riot charge, Ms. Goodman said she and her program would continue to cover the pipeline protests. “The state’s attorney was attempting to stop journalism,” she said. “The state’s attorney must respect freedom of the press and the First Amendment.” Ms. Goodman, a Polk Award-winning journalist, was originally charged with criminal trespass on Sept. 8, after she reported on a violent clash between protesters and security guards on Sept. 3, at a construction site near Mandan for the Dakota Access pipeline. The project has been the subject of protests by members of the Standing Rock Sioux tribe, among others. Several guards were injured, according to news reports, and Ms. Goodman reported that protesters had been doused with pepper spray and that dogs had been used against them. On Friday, the prosecutor, Mr. Erickson, dismissed the trespassing charge. Tom Dickson, one of Ms. Goodman’s lawyers, told The Associated Press that Mr. Erickson had informed him he planned to file a new charge against Ms. Goodman: engaging in a riot. The A.P. said the charge carried a penalty of up to 30 days in jail and a $1,500 fine. “The prosecutor seems to be determined to charge Amy with something,” Reed Brody, a lawyer for Ms. Goodman, said in a phone interview on Monday, before the judge’s decision. Ms. Goodman, 59, appeared in a short Facebook Live broadcast on Monday morning from Mandan as she was waiting to hear if a judge had approved the riot charge. “I wasn’t trespassing,” she said. “I wasn’t rioting. The ‘Democracy Now’ team and I were there to report, to document what was happening on the ground. These charges are simply a threat to all journalists around the country: Do not come to North Dakota.” Mr. Erickson, the prosecutor, told The Bismarck Tribune last week that Ms. Goodman’s actions went beyond reporting. “She’s a protester, basically,” he said. “Everything she reported on was from the position of justifying the protest actions.” Mr. Brody said that the prosecutor could seek other charges, such as disturbing the peace. “It’s hard to see what the State of North Dakota gains by charging a reporter with a crime for doing her work,” he said. “If the attempt is to prevent people from talking about the Dakota Access pipeline, it certainly has not worked out for them.” The 1,170-mile pipeline has drawn thousands of protesters, many from the Standing Rock Sioux and other tribes who say that federal authorities approved the project without fully taking into consideration the tribes’ concerns that it would damage their water supplies and cultural sites. The federal government last month temporarily blocked construction on parts of the project over those concerns.

"Times Insider He had arrived as an American-Israeli in a Palestinian village, but identities quickly faded as mutual trust and respect transcended politics. Times Insider explains who we are and what we do, and delivers behind-the-scenes insights into how our journalism comes together. Early one morning in April, I was jolted awake when Maysoon Sweity burst into the room. I knew what she was going to say before she said it — I could already smell the acrid odor of scorched plastic. “Get up, there’s a burn!” A half-mile away, past her sprawling backyard filled with olive, lemon and pomegranate trees, a massive plume of black smoke billowed from the base of the concrete slabs separating her Palestinian village from Israel. For nearly two decades, a cadre of local Palestinians have burned Israeli electronic waste — primarily insulated electrical cables — to extract valuable metals for resale and to dispose of the leftover scraps. The fires are an offshoot of a vast, robust, informal sector that recycles and refurbishes e-waste and electronics imported from Israel, yet they have had an outsized impact on Palestinian villages and nearby Israeli towns. I lived in the town of Beit Awwa in the southern West Bank for almost a month across seven visits between November 2017 and April 2019. I photographed the burns, the Palestinians affected by them, and the broader e-waste sector that has become an unlikely boon for thousands of Palestinians struggling economically amid the Israeli occupation. On my first trip, I joined Dr. Yaakov Garb, an environmental scientist from Israel’s Ben Gurion University, during one of his many visits to the area. Dr. Garb has studied the sector extensively and developed close relationships with the community. He and a coalition of Israelis and Palestinians were in the midst of facilitating an ambitious grass-roots project to stop the burns and sustainably reform the sector. The urgency was clear: People were sick, and burn sites were scattered throughout the villages. Studies by Dr. Garb and his research partners suggested this was no coincidence. To me — an American-Israeli who grew up between the D.C. suburbs of Maryland and Israel — the burns, the noble attempt to stop them, the little-known e-waste sector and the community enduring despite the circumstances defied the common tropes of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. It felt like a story worth telling. To report and photograph in any community — especially where people are undergoing significant hardship — it is critical to develop relationships and build trust. Achieving that here was going to be a slow, deliberate process, especially because I speak Hebrew, not Arabic, and very few villagers speak English. Through the invaluable assistance of local translators whom I met via Dr. Garb, I spoke with dozens of people — in living rooms and medical clinics, at scrapyards, on bustling streets. When I was without a translator, the shared language between the villagers and me was most often Hebrew. I was initially concerned about speaking it publicly. A monument to a Palestinian who attacked Israelis in Hebron years ago, which occupies the center of a roundabout near the entrance to Beit Awwa, was not reassuring. Every time I passed it, I was reminded of the legacy of violence that has scarred both sides of the conflict. Yet the more I spoke Hebrew the more I felt trusted, and the more doors opened. I had arrived as an American-Israeli in a Palestinian village, but identities quickly faded as mutual trust and respect superseded political inclinations and suspicion. Over time, villagers came to recognize me and understood that I cared not only about the story, but also about the community. I attended a wedding and a funeral, shared countless cups of coffee and meals, and on one occasion cooked dinner for Mrs. Sweity and her family. In conversation, villagers repeated similar sentiments: People want decent work so they can take care of their families; they want to breathe clean air and live in peace with Israelis. By my last trips in January and April, the binational efforts to stop the burns had collapsed over political differences despite support from both governments. Fires were a nearly daily occurrence. Waking up to the smell of burned plastic was common. Though I did not expect to end this project by documenting a return to the status quo, I’m still hopeful. I witnessed firsthand the willingness of Israelis and Palestinians to work together across the divide. Ahmad Sweity, a member of Mrs. Sweity’s extended family who was born and raised in Beit Awwa, echoed a feeling shared across the villages and beyond the West Bank’s border: “We’re living in one house.

"MANAMA, Bahrain — Saudi Arabia’s foreign minister on Saturday rejected a call by President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of Turkey to try the suspects in the killing of the dissident commentator Jamal Khashoggi in that country, saying that the men arrested would be prosecuted on Saudi soil. Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir called the international outrage over the killing “fairly hysterical” and said that once the Saudi investigation was complete, the suspects would be held accountable “in Saudi Arabia.” “Unfortunately, there has been this hysteria in the media before the investigation was complete,” he said during a panel at the Manama Dialogue, which was organized by the International Institute for Strategic Studies in Manama, the capital of Bahrain. Mr. Khashoggi, a Virginia resident and a columnist for The Washington Post who was also a critic of Saudi Arabia’s current rulers, was killed on Oct. 2 by a team of Saudi agents in the Saudi Consulate in Istanbul. Turkish officials have said that the agents dismembered Mr. Khashoggi with a bone saw in order to dispose of the body, as part of a premeditated assassination. Many current and former Western officials have argued that such an operation could have been authorized only by Saudi Arabia’s de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman. In a speech this past week, Mr. Erdogan called on Saudi Arabia to extradite any suspects for a trial in Turkey. He has argued that the rulers of Saudi Arabia face a conflict of interest in overseeing any trial because the killing was ordered and directed from within the Saudi government for political reasons. Mr. Jubeir’s remarks on Saturday amounted to a rejection of Mr. Erdogan’s request for extradition, as expected. The foreign minister also did not directly respond to questions about how the kingdom would convince its allies that Prince Mohammed had no ties to the killing. Saudi Arabia acknowledged that Mr. Khashoggi had died inside the consulate only after more than two weeks of changing stories. Last Saturday, the kingdom said its investigators had concluded that Saudi agents accidentally strangled Mr. Khashoggi during a brawl that broke out while they were attempting to persuade him to voluntarily return home. On Thursday, however, the kingdom revised its story, saying that Turkey had provided evidence that showed the killing had been premeditated. That disclosure appeared to have been timed to get ahead of a report to President Trump by the director of the C.I.A., Gina Haspel, who visited Ankara, the Turkish capital, this past week. Turkish officials have said they have audio recordings of the killings inside the consulate, presumably obtained though surveillance, and Ms. Haspel was expected to hear those recordings. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis, who spoke at the conference earlier in the day, said Mr. Khashoggi’s death “undermines regional stability.” He promised the United States would seek to hold accountable those responsible for the death, though he did not mention Saudi Arabia by name. The kingdom said it had arrested 18 Saudis in connection with the killing. The royal court also fired a number of senior intelligence officials said by Saudi officials to have orchestrated the operation or participated in covering it up. Also fired was Saud al-Qahtani, a close adviser to Prince Mohammed who was said to have played a role in creating the environment in which violence was used against Mr. Khashoggi. But neither Mr. Qahtani nor the intelligence officials have been arrested by the kingdom, raising questions about its commitment to holding them accountable. In his comments on Saturday, Mr. Jubeir, the Saudi foreign minister, said the kingdom’s alliance with the United States was “ironclad.” He praised Mr. Trump’s regional foreign policy as “rational, realistic.” After the investigation, he added, “we will know the truth.” “We will put in place measures to stop it from happening again,” he said. “And we will be transparent about it.”",Saudi Foreign Minister Denies Erdogan’s Call for Extradition of Khashoggi Suspects,Saudi Foreign Minister Denies Erdogan’s Call for Arrest of Saudis in Khashoggi Killing,Saudi Foreign Minister Denies Turkish Call for Extradition of Journalists,10,10,10,10,10,9,10,10,10
" (CNN)Democratic Rep. Tim Ryan -- whose name has been floated as a potential opponent to House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi's re-election bid -- said Wednesday that he hasn't decided yet whether to mount a Democratic leadership challenge but that he believes Democrats need a shake-up. ""Look, the Obamas are gone. The Clintons are gone. The Bidens are gone. Harry Reid is gone. There's no one at the (Democratic National Committee) now. We've got to -- we've got to say, what's America 2.0 look like?"" Ryan said in an interview on CNN's ""New Day."" ""We've got to re-evaluate what we're doing as Democrats, especially in the congressional campaign,"" the Ohio Democrat said. Asked by CNN's Poppy Harlow whether he was planning on challenging Pelosi when Democrats hold their leadership elections after the Thanksgiving break, Ryan was coy.  ""That's the conversation we're having right now. My main goal was to get the election delayed. We were supposed to have it tomorrow, and now it's delayed for a couple weeks so we can actually have that conversation,"" Ryan said. Pelosi formally announced Wednesday in a letter to supporters that she was seeking re-election.  ""It is with both humility and confidence that I write to request your support for House Democratic Leader,"" Pelosi said. ""As of this writing, I am pleased to report the support of more than two-thirds of the Caucus."" Ryan was careful to also express his admiration for Pelosi and said he didn't blame her for Democrats' stinging losses in 2016.  ""Let me just say, I love Nancy Pelosi. She's an amazing woman. She's got more energy than probably half of our Democratic caucus and is a terrific fundraiser, and I don't blame her for the past election. It wasn't her fault. We did get caught up in a national wave."" And Ryan said he hadn't yet decided whom to support in the race for chair of the DNC, adding, ""I've got a lot of respect for all"" the candidates and that ""I don't have a horse in that race yet."" Ryan also discussed President-elect Donald Trump's appointment of Stephen Bannon as a senior adviser, a move assailed by critics who have accused Bannon of catering to white supremacists and nationalists in his former role as chief of Breitbart News.  ""I think it's going to be very, very hard to work with,"" Ryan said. ""I can see a scenario where there's going to be a lot of Democrats who aren't going to want to be in meetings or want to work with Trump if that guy is in the room."" He continued, ""First and foremost, it would be very helpful if he didn't appoint somebody or give someone a very high position that was very sympathetic to white supremacist groups."" Ryan said that ""there are things we would work with him on,"" such as reforming campaign finance and passing an infrastructure spending bill. But he added, ""If he pushed this right-wing agenda, we're going to fight him every step of the way."" The Democrat also sketched out his vision for the kind of messaging he believes Democrats should adopt, stressing the importance of speaking to the kinds of working-class voters who carried Trump to the White House. ""People don't want to hear about job retraining. People don't want to hear about running a computer. They want to -- they want you to talk to them about how they can run machinery, or run a back hoe or sling concrete block. That's what they want to do. So we need an agenda for Democrats that speaks to those workers,"" Ryan said. He pointed to the renewable energy industry as an example of an issue Democrats could seize on to recapture those voters. ""I don't think we talked about it enough. There are 8,000 component parts to a windmill. There's gear shifts, hydraulics. These things need to be manufactured. And if the United States of America says we're going in on a clean-energy economy, and we are going to manufacture those products -- in coal country, in Youngstown, Ohio, in the industrial Midwest, in the Great Lakes region -- I mean, that is what we do in that region. We make those. So we need national policies that are going to allow us to get there.""

"Mini-Vows Simone Rachel Press and Michael Richard Foy met at the end of December 2016 after joining a tour group at a hostel in the remote town of Alice Springs in Australia’s Northern Territory. “They had a massive rainstorm,” said Mr. Foy, who had locked eyes with Ms. Press during the orientation for a rigorous 10-day tour through the Australian Outback to Melbourne. “They get that amount of rain once every 20 years,” he said, adding that waterfalls were rolling off Uluru, the massive sandstone rock formation. While the group of 25 were stuck at the hostel an extra day, they had dinner at a local pub where Ms. Press offered Mr. Foy her leftover chicken Parmesan. “Once she gave me her chicken parm,” said Mr. Foy, who was from Auckland, New Zealand, he recalled thinking ‘I’ll be nice to her.’’’ On the road, where daily temperature averaged 105 degrees, he gave her a hand with her bags and they became bus buddies. “He’s very charming, calming and confident,” said Ms. Press, who grew up in Brooklyn, and in recent years lived in Santa Monica, Calif. During the trip they rode a camel together, ate kangaroo burgers and stayed at a hotel in the underground opal mining town of Coober Pedy. “I thought she was a go-getter and knew what she wanted, he said. “Not precious.” Ms. Press’s sense of adventure reached its limit in the desert, where they had enjoyed beer and Shiraz under the stars, and had their first kiss. “There was an eight-inch poisonous spider and a ton of creepy crawlies everywhere,” she said, and after a scorpion jumped out of a woman’s swag, a canvas sleeping compartment, she swiftly joined Mr. Foy in his swag. As skeptical as they both were about anyone pairing off in the group, Ms. Press said they became a “tour couple,” and they kept in touch after the trip. They soon visited each other in Santa Monica and Auckland, and later in 2017 Ms. Press showed up for a more extended stay with a one-way ticket and four suitcases. A few months later they got an apartment in Ponsonby, New Zealand. After two years, she was ready to go home to friends and family and to her dachshund, Ellie, but before she did, Mr. Foy engineered a proposal in July 2019 at the CRC Speedshow Car Expo in New Zealand, where they each accompanied a racing professional — she in a Toyota Starlet and he in a Nissan March — in a racing and stunt demonstration. They then got out of their cars for an interview by the M.C. Their drivers got back into their cars, but Mr. Foy’s driver, Paul Radisich, a retired popular racer, got out of his car again. “Hey mate,’’ Mr. Foy recalled him saying, as he held out a box. “You forgot this.’’ After Mr. Foy got down on one knee on the track, Ms. Press said yes to the rousing cheers and applause of spectators. “My life has been a complete and utter adventure,” she said, and on Feb. 1 Mr. Foy relocated to Santa Monica. ■ The couple were married Feb. 14 by a clerk at the Santa Barbara County Courthouse in California. A small gathering enjoyed sparkling New Zealand wine and a three-tier pink rose cake with matching flowers made by Jordan Rondel, who owns the Caker, a popular bakery in Auckland. ■ Three of Mr. Foy’s cousins traveled from New Zealand for the wedding. His older brother, Phillip, surprised him and was also in attendance. ■ Ms. Press, 33, is the recruiting lead at Whip Media Group in Santa Monica, Calif. She graduated from Tufts University. She is the daughter of Risë Zucker Press and Leonard S. Press of Cherry Valley, N.Y. ■ Mr. Foy, also 33, until January was a project engineer at JMP Engineering, a mechanical engineering firm in Auckland. He graduated from the Manukau Institute of Technology.

" (CNN)On Sunday afternoon, President Donald Trump quoted snippets from a New York Times article by Michael Grynbaum headlined: ""Trump's Briefings Are a Ratings Hit. Should Networks Cover Them Live?"" The essence of the piece dealt with the delicate journalistic question of what responsibility TV networks owe to their viewers to broadcast the President discussing the ongoing coronavirus epidemic given that these near-daily briefings have now turned into Trump spouting mistruths and settling scores with journalists. Trump seemed to miss the point of the article -- likely on purpose. He selectively quoted the piece to focus on Grynbaum's noting of how well the coronavirus task force briefings have been performing in terms of TV ratings. Here's the first part of the column Trump tweet quoted: ""President Trump is a ratings hit. Since reviving the daily White House briefing Mr. Trump and his coronavirus updates have attracted an average audience of 8.5 million on cable news, roughly the viewership of the season finale of 'The Bachelor.' Numbers are continuing to rise..."" It went on from there but, well, you get the idea. Aside from misunderstanding the actual point of Grynbaum's piece -- yes, these briefings do well in terms of ratings but is it responsible to carry them -- there's something deeply wrong with how Trump both prioritizes the importance of ratings and what they actually mean. Start with Trump clearly seeing the ratings for his briefings as a mark of some sort of success he has achieved.   This is not a new thing for Trump. As a reality TV star -- and a cable TV obsessive -- long before he began running for president, ratings have always been the thing he has latched onto as an objective measure of success. If it rates, it is good. Period.  A scroll through his Twitter feed reveals his longtime ratings obsessions. Using the ""search"" function at the amazing Trump Twitter Archive reveals 341 occurrences of the word ""ratings"" in Trump's tweets. His first ratings tweet came May 25, 2010, when Trump typed: ""The ratings for the Celebrity Apprentice were fantastic and everyone had a great time. It was a terrific season -- congrats to everyone!""   And practically every week he has commented at least once on ratings -- either low or high -- for some TV network. And in a May 2019 tweet he even took credit for high ratings; ""Also, congratulations to @OANN on the great job you are doing and the big ratings jump ('thank you President Trump')!,"" he tweeted. So, yes, Trump has always cared about ratings. But to focus on them now as the country and the world battle a pandemic that experts are saying could lead to the deaths of between 100,000 and 200,000 Americans? It's beyond unseemly. Which leads to the even more troubling character traits Trump's ratings tweets reveal. In Trump's mind, the reason that people are watching the briefings is because of him. Not because they are scared, nervous and trying to gather as much information as they can to make decisions to help their families and themselves. Which is, of course, why people are watching. He doesn't understand that. Because for him, it's always, always, always about him. Asked about his ratings tweets during Sunday's coronavirus daily briefing, here's how Trump responded (bolding is mine): ""Well, I've read that CNN doesn't want to cover them. I've read that -- except they can't help them because their ratings are so high. You know, if the ratings were low, they wouldn't be here. This man wouldn't be here. In 100 years you could bet your life that he would never be here with CNN and all their cameras....because we help their ratings. We help -- we lift up their ratings because their ratings are very low. ... But I think the American public ultimately they should be the decider, it's like if they don't want to watch, they shouldn't watch."" ""We"" means ""me"" for Trump. The narcissism there -- whether you like Trump or hate him -- literally smacks you in the face. To be so focused on yourself when so many are struggling for their lives and their livelihoods is hard to take. But this is who Trump is. And he's not changing. Ever.

"DUBAI, United Arab Emirates — Souq.com, an online retailer based in the United Arab Emirates, said on Monday that it had raised $275 million from international investors. It was a vote of confidence for digital commerce in the Middle East, which has made little headway compared with elsewhere. Souq, the largest e-commerce company in the Middle East, was founded in 2005 on an eBay-like online auction model, but it subsequently evolved into more of an Amazon-style set-price retailer. It has been a rare success story in a region where online businesses face logistical problems, political challenges, stifling bureaucracy and regulations that vary greatly from country to country. Souq’s latest round of funding included money from the New York-based investment firm Tiger Global Management, as well as from Standard Chartered Private Equity and the International Finance Corporation, which is an arm of the World Bank. Souq, which means market in Arabic, did not provide details on what the funding round meant for its overall valuation, and it has not released details on its annual sales or profit. The $275 million funding round was, however, the largest ever disclosed by a technology start-up in the Middle East and North Africa, according to Wamda, a research firm based in Dubai, the United Arab Emirates. Even after multiple fund-raising rounds, the Jabbar Internet Group — which sold Maktoob, a news site, to Yahoo for more than $150 million in 2009 — still holds a majority stake. “The start-up scene has changed so much since Souq launched over 10 years ago,” Ronaldo Mouchawar, the chief executive of Souq, said in an interview, “and the size and scope of this kind of funding is encouraging for entrepreneurs.” Mr. Mouchawar said the company would use the funds to bolster its technology, such as payment processing, and to help increase the scale of its operations by improving logistics. Souq also hopes to introduce new product categories, particularly related to beauty and fashion, and to recruit employees, he said. In particular, it will look to improve its mobile application; Mr. Mouchawar noted that 70 percent of purchases from Souq in Saudi Arabia, the Middle East’s second-biggest market, were made on phones. Souq, now the largest online retailer in the Arab world, ships hundreds of thousands of products across the six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council: Bahrain, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates. It also has operations in Egypt. “Most local retailers — whether they will openly admit it or not — are fully aware that customers can find products cheaper online, whether locally or on global sites,” said Alexandra Tohme, an independent e-commerce analyst with more than a decade of marketing experience in the region. “In some cases, even heavy items with shipping charges still generate savings of up to 50 percent compared to brick-and-mortar stores.” Ms. Tohme said Souq’s particular success was driven by competitive prices compared with other retailers in the region, and by its reputation for reliable delivery. Several other online retailers have tried, and failed, to overcome the myriad difficulties of e-commerce in the Middle East. Barriers to trade across the region remain high and include tariffs, varying national laws and different currencies. Political instability can also be an obstacle in countries like Egypt, whose population of nearly 90 million has endured heightened levels of violence since an uprising in 2011. The high costs associated with online retail can also discourage start-ups. As a result, several major online retailers have struggled: Joob, an online travel website started by the Jabbar Internet Group, folded with little explanation a year after its introduction in 2011; the German start-up fund Rocket Internet closed Mizado, an Amazon copycat, in 2012, after just five months of operation, to concentrate on the online shoe retailer Namshi, it said. That same year, the online daily deals website LivingSocial abruptly exited the Middle East. The market’s potential remains attractive, however. “By the end of the decade, two-thirds of the region will have smart devices — supercomputers in their pockets — which means increased innovation, problem-solving and purchasing power,” said Christopher M. Schroeder, an American venture capitalist.",Souq.com Raises $275 Million in Middle East,Souq.com Raises $275 Million in Middle East,Souq.com Raises $275 Million to Fund Its Growth,10,10,10,9,9,10,10,10,10
"Op-Ed Contributor WHEN Muhammad Ali said, “I ain’t got no quarrel with them Vietcong. No Vietcong ever called me nigger,” he spoke for many of the black soldiers and Marines who were in Vietnam fighting for an America that continued to oppress and marginalize them. One night in Chu Lai, I heard a black Marine say to a white one, “Look, I don’t want to hear ‘gook’ or ‘dink’ ’cause I don’t know what you’ll call me tomorrow.” I was in Vietnam — a reporter for the military newspaper Southern Cross — two years after Ali had been convicted of dodging the draft in the summer of ’67. Thousands of black soldiers were fighting in Cu Chi, Phu Bai, Long Binh, Da Nang and hundreds of landing zones and firebases pockmarking South Vietnam, some wearing black unity wrist bands braided out of boot laces. Most received news of the civil rights movement — sit-ins, bombings, struggles with the police and dogs in the streets of cities and towns across America — in letters from home and in magazine headlines in those rare moments of stand-down at division headquarters. Racial tension would often flare up in the rear. We knew the uniform or code of conduct couldn’t erase what was in the hearts or on the lips of troops at the enlisted men’s clubs where they guzzled 3.2 beer. Then the next day, the soldiers and Marines would plunge back into the leafy quagmire of the jungle or climb the bald hills of firebases for another deadly encounter with the Vietcong or North Vietnamese Army. Ali was more than life-size in the psyche of the black soldier. Other conscientious objectors were in Canada or Sweden, but here stood a black man, the heavyweight champion of the world, saying, “Why should they ask me to put on a uniform and go 10,000 miles from home and drop bombs and bullets on brown people in Vietnam while so-called Negro people in Louisville are treated like dogs and denied simple human rights?” Of course, some black soldiers knew this fueled North Vietnam’s propaganda, and Hanoi Hannah’s radio rants across the rice paddies, but they also knew the hard reality of race and politics transported overseas. It wasn’t uncommon to see two black G.I.s from different units walk up to each other and tap their clenched fists together — without exchanging a single word. Behind the “dap” between young black soldiers in Vietnam was a scream. It was a greeting of kindred souls, but it was also, if not an outright affront, at least a bold statement within the military machine. The dap was a counteraction to a fraternity of ritual that prided itself on ironclad tradition, whose first mission was to challenge the idea of the individual and personal style. At times, the dap seemed choreographed to Ali’s words, a dance of defiance on the edge of battle. For most of the black officers and career noncoms in ’Nam, however, this ritual by young black G.I.s broke rank with the history of blacks serving in combat, and some saw it as a direct affront to that fought-for social terrain. Many of these career soldiers also did not agree with Ali. They were determined to prove that change happened from within an institution. Hadn’t they put their lives on the line — in many instances heroically — to prove this by acquiring status through rank? The enlisted men — whether black or white — had less hope. In that climate of blood and dust where buddies were maimed or killed, the survivors often made desperate claims. And some black G.I.s told themselves that if change didn’t happen, there would be blood in the streets when they returned home. But what many black vets felt after they returned was self-betrayal. War had changed us. We were alone. Flower power was everywhere. Big Brother and the Holding Company. Nina Simone. Jimi Hendrix. Some vets were hiding out in the woods, on the edge. Others were lost in suburbia. And every now and then one of us would meet a ghost of himself talking in anonymous streets across America. Some of us had taken blood oaths and participated in scrimmages we are ashamed of — the tragedy of My Lai being one of many. Others returned with nightmares riding shotgun in our heads. Ali was not exactly a slayer of the “masters of war,” but it meant something to us that, as a young man, a beleaguered citizen, he had stood up to the most powerful country on earth.",Opinion | Muhammad Ali’s ‘Dap’,Opinion | Muhammad Ali’s ‘Dap’,Opinion | Muhammad Ali’s Legacy,10,10,10,8,8,9,9,9,8
"WASHINGTON — Rhona Graff, President Trump’s longtime executive assistant, was asked for documents related to foreign governments providing gifts or money to Ivanka Trump or her businesses. Anatoli Samochornov, the Russian translator who sat in on a meeting between Trump campaign officials and Russian lobbyists, was asked to hand over handwritten notes showing any capital investment from Russian entities to Ms. Trump or her businesses. And Jeff Sessions, the former attorney general, was asked for any documents related to loans or capital investments from Russians directed to Ms. Trump. The president’s elder daughter and top White House adviser was notably absent from a blitz of document requests that the House Judiciary Committee sent earlier this month to 81 individuals and organizations linked to the president. House Democrats have been cautious about targeting Ms. Trump and the other Trump children as they investigate the president, worried about triggering a backlash. But a close read of the document requests suggests they aren’t exactly tiptoeing around the first daughter, either. Of the 81 document requests sent, 52 individuals and organizations were asked to turn over documents related to Ms. Trump or her business interests. White House officials are viewing the document requests as an attempt by the House Judiciary Committee to set the stage for potentially impeaching the president. But the inquiries related to Ms. Trump follow a side track: They ask for documents related to any financial benefit that Ms. Trump or her businesses reaped from foreign and domestic governments after the 2016 election. And they provide a hint of how Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York, chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, may be planning to look into potential financial conflicts of interest from Ms. Trump. “She’d be in violation of the Constitution if she was getting any business deals from foreign governments,” said Richard W. Painter, who served as chief ethics lawyer under President George W. Bush. Mr. Painter was referring to the emoluments clause of the Constitution, which prohibits government officials from accepting payments or gifts from foreign governments. “They’re also going after other payments that aren’t emoluments clause violations that we ought to know about that could be creating financial conflicts of interest for her,” Mr. Painter said. “The idea here is to get an awful lot of information we would have had if there had been more detailed disclosures about the entities the Trump family controls.” A spokesman for the House Judiciary Committee declined to comment on the committee’s interest in Ms. Trump. But Mr. Nadler has said that the 81 requests were only the first tranche and that requests to others, including Ms. Trump, could “quite conceivably” follow. The characters working behind the scenes on the document requests also provide a hint of what the Judiciary Committee is looking for. In February, House Democrats retained Norman L. Eisen, a litigator and prominent Trump critic, to begin its inquiries into the president. Mr. Eisen, who played a large role in overseeing the document requests, has also been vocal about potential emoluments clause violations from the president and his family. In December 2016, for instance, he was an author of a report for the Brookings Institution, “The Emoluments Clause: Its text, meaning, and application to Donald J. Trump.” Ms. Trump and her husband, Jared Kushner, never completely divested from their companies even after taking top White House positions. Their income in 2017, from various investments they remained involved in through vehicles and trusts, was $82 million to $222 million, according to their ethics disclosures. In 2017, Ms. Trump earned more than $5 million from her namesake fashion brand, according to financial disclosures. In July 2018, Ms. Trump shut down her fashion brand, amid concerns that the family was profiting from the presidency. But she has continued to seek trademarks in China to avoid competitors from profiting off her name, according to a spokeswoman. House Democrats appear to be looking to see if she leveraged her role in government to profit for herself. Among those asked to produce documents that could show foreign-government involvement with Ms. Trump are George Nader, the Lebanese-American businessman who is cooperating with the special counsel’s inquiry; Erik Prince, the founder of the security contractor formerly known as Blackwater; Matthew Calamari, the former Trump bodyguard turned businessman; and Hope Hicks, a former White House communications director. Others were Corey Lewandowski, the former Trump campaign manager; Michael T. Flynn, the former national security adviser, and Allen Weisselberg, the chief financial officer of the Trump Organization. Sarah Huckabee Sanders, the White House press secretary, did not respond to a request for comment. Abbe Lowell, a lawyer for Mr. Kushner, declined to comment.",Ivanka Trump’s Family Is Not Involved in Emoluments Request,Ivanka Trump’s Family Is Not Included in House Judiciary Committee’ed Request for Documents,House Judiciary Committee Seeks Documents on Trump’s Businesses,10,10,8,7,10,4,8,10,7
"Her sister recommended that she only drink hard liquor with diet mixers that didn't have a lot of calories. Alice took it one step further. ""Before nights out, which would be, like, four times a week in my first year, sometimes even more, I'd just eat Special K or another bowl of low-calorie cereal, no milk. I figured I'd need to spend less money on booze to get drunk, and it would be less calories, so it was win–win,"" she said glibly, which is perhaps the only way to look back on something dumb—and potentially dangerous—you did in your college years. The phenomenon of drunkorexia, or restricting one's calorie intake to ""make room"" for carb-heavy alcoholic beverages, has appeared in the news before. In 2008, the disordered eating pattern was written about, eyebrow raisingly, in the ""Fashion & Style"" section of the New York Times, but the evidence for it at the time was only anecdotal, and some called it an overhyped, youth-shaming myth. However, new analysis from the Research Society on Alcoholism reveals that drunkorexia is very real—and common among college students who either want to minimize weight gain, get exceedingly wasted on a small amount of Burnett's, or both. Researchers say this is closely linked to alcohol abuse and can have especially negative health effects, though many who would qualify as ""drunkorexic"" tend to think managing their calories to compensate for partying hard is reasonable. ""We know that it's not just the amount or frequency that college students drink, but the way in which they drink that puts them at higher risk of experiencing problems related to alcohol use,"" Dr. Dipali V. Rinker, an assistant professor in the department of psychology at the University of Houston who worked on the study, told Broadly over the phone. ""I wanted to look at the ways students behave before, during, and after drinking,"" she said. After surveying college students on campus and online, Dr. Rinker found that many students form complex webs of compensatory drinking behaviors. ""People will [eat less] to get drunk more quickly—obviously, there's a big difference between drinking on a full stomach or drinking on an empty stomach; restrict their food during the day [when they plan to drink later]; consume low-calorie drinks during; or the next day they will make up for it by not eating or over-exercising. There are also bulimic-type compensatory behaviors,"" she said. Melissa* described these methods in practice. ""When I went to the gym, I felt like I gave myself the OK to drink [later] that night because I had burned off most or all of the calories I had ingested,"" she said in an email. But if you want hard numbers (Dr. Rinker's research on the subject has not been published yet), a study published in Australian Psychologist reports that 57.7 percent of female students surveyed said they made up for their alcohol intake in some way. Dr. Rinker said that people who are drunkorexic end up drinking more and experiencing more problems related to drinking than those who do not engage in compensatory drinking behaviors. While this confluence of an eating disorder and a drinking problem is obviously risky, people who engage in the dieting-to-drink pattern don't often realize it, she said. ""Someone who thinks that the typical college student drinks [a lot] is more likely themselves to drink,"" Dr. Rinker said of problem drinking in general. The same holds true for drunkorexia, which appears to be a sort of self-perpetuating problem. While compensatory drinking behaviors are ""more common than [she] expected,"" Dr. Rinker said, college students think that their peers are doing it even more frequently than they actually are. She adds that women with a history of disordered eating are more likely to engage in these behaviors. Surprisingly, simply informing students that their peers are not, in fact, getting tanked on the regular can help curb disordered drinking. ""It's the whole idea that everybody's doing it, so I'm doing it, when that's not really true. We've found that when we report to people that the actual amount a typical college student drinks is a lot less than they [themselves] drink, they do reduce their drinking,"" she said. This could be a first step in addressing drunkorexia among student populations. ""Providing accurate drinking norms could certainly be a component of an intervention that actually helps."" *Names have been changed.",College Students Are Drinking More Than You Think,"College Students Are Drinking More, and It's a Bad Thing",How to Avoid Drunkorexia,5,2,5,6,3,9,7,9,5
"Washington (CNN)Fired FBI Director James Comey saw a tweet from President Donald Trump and made a decision that will have untold ramifications. ""James Comey better hope that there are no 'tapes' of our conversations before he starts leaking to the press!"" Trump tweeted on the morning of May 12. It was that tweet, Comey told the Senate intelligence committee Thursday, that spurred him to leak contents of his memos documenting interactions with the President to the press. ""The President tweeted on Friday, after I got fired, that I better hope there's not tapes,"" Comey said. ""I woke up in the middle of the night on Monday night, because it didn't dawn on me originally, that there might be corroboration for our conversation, there might be a tape."" Comey, who wrote memos after his meetings with Trump, had shared the documents with fellow FBI officials. Asked during the Senate hearing if he shared the memos elsewhere, Comey explained he asked a ""good friend"" who is a ""professor at Columbia law school"" to be an intermediary with the press. ""My judgment was I needed to get that out into the public square. So I asked a friend of mine to share the content of the memo with a reporter,"" Comey said. ""I didn't do it myself for a variety of reasons, but I asked him to because I thought that might prompt the appointment of a special counsel, so I asked a close friend of mine to do it,"" he said. The go-between Daniel C. Richman, a close Comey adviser and former federal prosecutor, confirmed to CNN in an email that he was the friend Comey was referencing in his testimony.   During the hearing, Comey was asked specifically if the ""friend"" he referred to was journalist Benjamin Wittes, who is also a senior fellow at the Brookings Institute.  Wittes was contributing to a live blog when Comey told lawmakers that Wittes was not used as a go-between to share the information with the media and commented on Richman's role in the process. ""Dan is an exceptionally fine person. He and Jim have been close friends for many years. There is nothing illegal, improper or dishonorable about what he did in this instance,"" Wittes said in a post on the LawFare blog once news that Richman had confirmed he was the individual referenced by Comey. ""He and Comey are now acknowledging his hand in the story in question and the role he played. So it's not even an anonymous leak in any sense that a normal person would understand the term,"" he added.  Trump lawyer slams leak Trump's outside counsel, Marc Kasowitz, slammed Comey over the leak. ""Today, Mr. Comey admitted that he leaked to friends his purported memos of these privileged conversations, one of which he testified was classified,"" Kasowitz said at a news conference. ""He also testified that immediately after he was terminated, he authorized his friends to leak the contents of these memos to the press in order to 'prompt the appointment of a special counsel.'""   He added, ""We will leave it the appropriate authorities to determine whether these leaks should be investigated along with all those others being investigated."" Kasowitz did not take any questions. The reporter who wrote the first ""Comey memo"" story, Michael Schmidt of The New York Times, told CNN's Brian Stelter, ""I'm going to decline to comment"" on any interactions with Richman. Schmidt's story was attributed to ""two people who read the memo."" Despite being unusual, Comey's revelation that he asked Richman to share the content of the memos with the media in order to prompt the appointment of special counsel is unlikely to pose a legal issue, according to CNN legal analyst and University of Texas law professor Stephen Vladeck.  ""It's not generally illegal for former government employees -- or their friends -- to disclose internal government memos without appropriate authorization,"" Vladeck said. ""There is no legal blowback here."" ""There are exceptions, including cases in which the memos involve 'information relating to the national defense,' which might trigger the Espionage Act, or in which the disclosure of the memos deprives the government of a 'thing of value,' which might trigger the federal conversion-of-property statute,"" he noted. ""And it may well be a violation of a government employee's contract or non-disclosure agreement to release such memos. But the sanctions there are administrative -- and couldn't run to a former government employee or, in Richman's case, a non-government employee,"" Vladeck said.

"TOKYO — Japan still faces deep structural problems. Its population is aging and dwindling. China has stepped up its manufacturing game. Corporate stalwarts like Toshiba and Kobe Steel have stumbled. Investors appear to be looking at the bright side. Japan’s main stock index rose to its highest level in almost 21 years on Wednesday, buoyed by a broad rally in global markets as well as growing optimism about the Japanese economy. The surge came despite the continuing problems at Kobe Steel, a Japanese stock market stalwart. Its shares sank sharply for a second day after revelations that it had falsified data about the quality of aluminum and copper products shipped to hundreds of customers. In large part, Japan’s stronger stock market is part of a global rise in optimism. Stock market measures in the United States have also hit new highs in recent weeks, while stocks in South Korea also hit a record on Wednesday. Markets have been lifted by robust global growth and expanding corporate profits, as the world finally appears to be shrugging off years of crises and sluggish growth. But Japan has some of its own good news to share. Japan’s gross domestic product has expanded for six consecutive quarters, the first time it has gone that long without a contraction in 11 years. Unemployment is at multidecade lows, and corporations are experiencing a surge in profits. Even Japan’s longtime economic bugbear — persistent wage and price deflation — has eased, with both consumer prices and incomes showing modest gains. On Wednesday, the government said corporate machinery orders, a closely watched indicator of business spending, had risen for the second month in a row in August, gaining 3.4 percent. It will be some time before Japan can hope to set all-time records. Stocks remain well below the levels they achieved at the height of Japan’s late-1980s asset bubble. The bursting of that bubble left the country with a glut of production capacity for years, a result of dwindling consumption and overinvestment during the boom years. That imbalance is beginning to be rectified. Growing global demand for Japan’s goods, a tightening labor market and a number of other factors have taken up some of that slack. The business cycle also has been favorable: Companies are beginning to spend more to maintain aging factories and equipment, said Mitsumaru Kumagai, chief economist at the Daiwa Institute of Research. That improvement is still nascent, Mr. Kumagai and others warn. Japan’s growth spurt has been modest, and the wage and price gains are in their early days. Japan still has overcapacity to deal with. “For capital spending to take off in earnest will require companies to use up even more of their factory capacity,” Mr. Kumagai said. The Nikkei 225 stock index on Wednesday edged up 58 points, or 0.28 percent, to close at 20,881, its highest level since December 1996. Japan’s recent stock moves have also been helped by the political scene in the country. Japan is set to hold parliamentary elections on Oct. 22, and analysts project that the governing Liberal Democratic Party will retain its hold on power. Led by Prime Minister Shinzo Abe, the Liberal Democrats have pursued an expansionary economic policy, spending on public works and other projects and encouraging the central bank to keep borrowing costs low by buying up vast quantities of government debt. Such measures, collectively known as Abenomics, have been credited with helping drive the stock market higher. Mr. Abe was not required to call an election this year, but he dissolved Parliament early in hopes of capitalizing on rebounding approval ratings and a disorganized opposition. Initially the move appeared to backfire, as the popular governor of Tokyo, Yuriko Koike, unexpectedly formed a new national party to challenge the Liberal Democrats. After a start that generated a flood of news coverage, Ms. Koike’s new venture has stumbled. Polls show only about 5 percent of voters support her Party of Hope, though about a third of those surveyed remain undecided.",Japan’s Stock Market Rises to 21st Century High,Japan’s Stock Market Rises to 21st Century High,Japan’s Stock Market Surges as China Takes Back Its Manufacturing Ground,8,8,8,8,8,10,10,10,2
"Eat Mumbai is a city of great egg dishes — hard-boiled curries and frankies, wrestler’s omelets and masala scrambles. Eggs Kejriwal is just one dish in its vast canon. This egg-and-cheese toast isn’t new, but it’s newly internationally famous, like a stage actor cast in a superhero film. I found my way to it last year at Paowalla in Manhattan — an egg with a warm, tender yolk under a fat blanket of melted cheese, smudged with bright green chutney. Jet-lagged, on deadline, I was restored by it again at Dishoom in London, a chain inspired by Mumbai’s old Irani cafes, where they grill the cheese until it’s golden and put two runny eggs on top. By then, I was a believer in this trinity of toast, egg and cheese, blessed with the raw heat of green chiles. It was a reliable fix for hangovers, solid enough to pass for breakfast but compact enough to snack on between meals. I made it at home after a long, inadequate restaurant dinner, kneeling in front of my broiler to keep an eye on the bubbling Cheddar, wondering where this stodgy little dreamboat had been all my life. The answer is precise: Until recently, eggs Kejriwal belonged only to South Mumbai. The dish had a local fan base, but was mostly unknown outside it. “Honestly, I never heard of it when I was growing up,” said the chef Preeti Mistry, who adapted eggs Kejriwal for her weekend brunch menu at Juhu Beach Club in Oakland. Mistry’s version is a glorious, maximalist mash-up with a croque-madame. She adds slices of bacon, dusting them with the same spices her kitchen uses to make chai, and layers the meat with eggs, Monterey Jack cheese and serranos. Though it sounds a bit like diner fare, eggs Kejriwal was born about 50 years ago on Mumbai’s exclusive social-club circuit. The original is still available at the Willingdon Sports Club, where a former member named Devi Prasad Kejriwal requested an egg-and-cheese toast cooked his way so frequently that they put it on the menu and named it after him. “The original had a sort of essential simplicity,” said Vikram Doctor, a food writer for India’s Economic Times. “It’s just toast and a poached egg, and a slice of processed cheese. It’s not fancy.” But he noticed variations popping up on more and more menus in Mumbai, and on social media. Doctor first wrote about the Kejriwal phenomenon five years ago, when he formed a theory that its sudden, viral growth might be tied to the rise of a Delhi politician who shared its name, Arvind Kejriwal. “The incongruity of this dish, also named Kejriwal — it’s a silly joke really.” Across India, the egg occupies an interesting position. Not meaty enough to be considered meat but not vegetal enough for everyone to agree that it’s vegetarian. “Eggs seem to fall in some odd limbo,” Doctor said. And the irresistible mythology of eggs Kejriwal relies on that limbo. Kejriwal, the club member, was a vegetarian. He also belonged to India’s Marwari community, who traditionally don’t eat eggs, and while he did not want to be seen out and about eating them, cheese was just fine. So kitchens hid eggs for him under cover of cheese and chiles. You could be true to the original, but being true to the original is overrated. And if you put the egg down first on the toast, then in an effort to thoroughly melt the cheese on top of it, you may accidentally cook the yolk through. It’s better if it runs. So instead, I smear the toasted bread with mustard, mix grated Cheddar with a little chopped red onion, green chiles and cilantro, and leave it all under the noisy, clacking broiler at the bottom of my oven. After a couple of minutes, the cheese is melted and just starting to bubble, and the edges of the toast are even more browned. I could stop here, I know, and sit down with a perfectly good chile-cheese toast, but that’s what I used to do before I knew about eggs Kejriwal. There is no going back.

"What to Cook Good morning. I wrote about the Philadelphia restaurateurs Mike Solomonov and Steven Cook this week, in a column for The Times that includes their recipe for Jerusalem mixed grill (above). I think that dish should absolutely be on your meal docket this weekend, to eat with hummus and pita. It’s not really a grilled dish. You make it on a griddle, or in a skillet. And while the recipe calls for a mix of chicken livers, hearts and chicken thighs, there’s no reason to cook the offal if you don’t want to or don’t like it. You can make mixed grill with straight chicken instead. The spicing is the point, a kind of amplified baharat that provides a warm and intriguing, almost smoky flavor to the meat. It’s ridiculously delicious, whether you make it into a pita pocket (good with cucumbers, tomato and onion, also with hot sauce) or simply mound the chicken on top of a few spoonfuls of hummus, as if it were polenta and the chicken a thick sauce. Make Jerusalem mixed grill tonight, maybe? That way you can clear Saturday night for Melissa Clark’s new recipe for baked polenta — a taste of comfort as spring struggles to make itself known. (Don’t eat meat? Bake some shells with spinach-artichoke dip and eat like a king this evening. Then, tomorrow night, cook Yotam’s spiced maqluba with tomatoes and tahini and make like a teenager texting: OMG fire emoji 100 100.) Other recipes to cook this weekend include my three-cup chicken, which I’ve lately turned into a kind of stew that I cook with lamb, simmering chunks of shoulder in the sauce for 40 minutes or so, until they’re super tender, and serving over rice, with oven-roasted green beans drizzled with oyster sauce. Also, Mark Bittman’s recipe for Cajun-style broiled shrimp, which you really ought to make with wild American shrimp because it will taste better and won’t leave you worried about the health of the shrimp themselves, and of the people who harvested them from ocean or farm-pond. And have you made Melissa Clark’s recipe for orange marmalade cake yet? You will not make it just once, I can tell you. Thousands more recipes to cook this weekend await you on NYT Cooking, at least once you’ve taken out a subscription to our site and apps. You can learn new skills there once you’ve finished browsing and saving recipes — how to make yogurt, for instance, and how to use an Instant Pot. We can help you build out a modern pantry.

Now, it doesn’t have anything to do with buttered peas or glistening roasts, but maybe you’d like to join our family discussion of the Netflix film “Triple Frontier.” Ben Blacker on Twitter suggested Natasha Lyonne should be cast as the new Columbo, and now all I can do is watch her like I need to write the pilot. Here’s her “Day in the Life” video for The Cut. This Harper’s essay on book criticism in the age of the algorithm is a lot to unpack. See what you think of it. Finally, I got a letter on Thursday from Elizabeth Swaney, the Olympic halfpipe skier I wrote about on Wednesday. She took issue with my characterization of her 2018 performance in Pyeongchang, which I said contained no tricks. She points out a safety grab, an alley-oop spin and a cruise 360 to switch.

"Washington (CNN)The Republican National Committee recently sent mailers to voters in Alabama that resembled Census forms, a RNC official confirmed to CNN. The political fundraising letter, ""2019 Congressional District Census,"" asked voters to fill out a survey and donate to President Donald Trump's reelection campaign, according to AL.com, which first reported the mailers. In an accompanying four-page letter that labeled the forms as a ""Census Document"" that is ""extremely important to our nation's future,"" the letter states, ""President Trump has requested that a Census of every Congressional District be conducted immediately,"" AL.com reported. According to the site, recipients were asked for donations ranging from $25-$1,000.  Also included in the mailer, according to AL.com, were questions like: ""Do you think 'political correctness' has gotten out of hand in America?"" and ""Do you approve or disapprove of the Democrats' never-ending witch hunt to try to impeach President Trump?"" The Alabama state department working on the upcoming 2020 census told CNN the mailers are not official forms and that the agency planned to use the existence of the forms to remind Alabama residents of the census count. ""We are simply reminding Alabamians that while this form resembles the general look of a census form, it is from a political party and is in no way related to the 2020 Census,"" Alabama Department of Consumer Affairs spokesperson Michael Presley told CNN.  ""Alabama Counts is using this opportunity to remind everyone of the following facts and timeline regarding the 2020 Census,"" Presley added. A federal law enacted in 2010, ""Prevent Deceptive Census Look Alike Mailings Act,"" bars nongovernmental entities from mailing letters with the term ""census."" However, two exceptions to the law include mailers with a disclaimer and ones that have a return address identifying the sender. The RNC official noted that the mailers were clearly marked that they were from the party. This isn't the first time fundraising letters resembling census forms have been sent. The tactic has been used by both political parties in the past, according to Adav Noti from the Campaign Legal Center, a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization that focuses on campaign finance laws.  ""It's been going on since the 1990 Census and maybe even earlier,"" said Noti, who noted the mailers are part of a larger fundraising practice. ""The practitioners say they are very successful, not just (with) the census-like ones, but all the ones that look like legal documents -- jury notices and court summonses.""    In September, Montana residents received letters in the mail that prompted the state to issue a warning. The advisory reminded individuals that the US Census Bureau doesn't solicit donations and that official documents will always be postmarked from the federal department, as first reported by the Bozeman Daily Chronicle. Similar incidents of alleged fundraisers being sent out as census-related mailers from the Republican Party were reported this past October in New York and Missouri.  Democrats have been called out for similar tactics. According to The Atlantic, Democrats sent out a questionnaire in February, that posed questions on specific issues and asked for money. A similar one was reportedly sent out in 2018, according to Newsday.  The survey, titled ""official 2019 Democratic Party survey,"" included questions like: Are you bothered by Donald Trump's ""reckless and dangerous foreign policy positions?"" and ""Which aspects of the Trump presidency do you find most disturbing? (please choose four)."" It also included a donation request.  Noti said one possible way to stop the fundraising practice would be to expand the federal law to blanket the letters.  ""It would be very simple to write a law: 'It's illegal to send mail that replicates or is intended to replicate an official census document.' But I think the fundraisers have worked out fairly easily... Ultimately the lawmakers are benefiting from these practices and [by] not strengthening the law.""  Presley told CNN that official census forms go out in Alabama starting on March 12, 2020, and reiterated that official US Census Bureau letters and surveys will always be from the US Department of Commerce, the department under which the Census Bureau falls.  ""The Census provides helpful information on their website to clearly determine the authenticity of its own Census mailer,"" a Census Bureau spokesperson said. The census is a count of US residents that takes place every 10 years conducted by the Census Bureau. The results of the census determines how federal funds are distributed to localities and helps determine the number of seats states have in the US House of Representatives.

"Washington (CNN)A lot can change in a week in Washington. Seven days ago, Judge Brett Kavanaugh seemed certain to be the next Supreme Court justice. A vote had been set in the Senate Judiciary Committee for this Thursday and the expectation was that all 11 Republicans would vote for him, ensuring that he would get a full floor vote. Where, in the very near future, the Republican majority would confirm him for the seat being vacated by retiring Justice Anthony Kennedy. Then came the news Sunday that a woman named Christine Blasey Ford, a professor in California, had spoken to The Washington Post -- putting a name and a face to the previously anonymous allegations that Kavanaugh had sexually assaulted a woman when they were both teenagers in the early 1980s. Suddenly, everything was up in the air.   The past five days have been dominated by Senate Republicans and the White House trying to wrap their arms around just how big a problem all of this is for Kavanaugh's confirmation. And each time they seemed to have a handle on it, the story started in another direction. Here's where we've landed (I think) at the end of this week: There is a very high likelihood that Ford and Kavanaugh will testify -- separately -- next week. The exact day remains up in the air as does whether the senators who sit on the committee will be the only people allowed to ask questions of the two witnesses. But Ford's attorneys and the Judiciary Committee are now talking -- and at this point it's hard to see how they don't find a way to get to an agreement, particularly given the stakes. As I've written, a hearing featuring Ford telling her story lessens the chances of Kavanaugh getting confirmed if for no other reason than it adds an element of uncertainty and drama into a proceeding that seemed drama-free at this time last week.  The Point, part 1: It remains true that Republicans have a one-seat edge on the Judiciary Committee, meaning that if they all support the President's nominee -- regardless of what Ford says -- Kavanaugh will make it out of committee and will likely be confirmed. The Point, part 2: It is also true, however, that Ford's testimony -- and what Kavanaugh says in response -- could change things, perhaps profoundly. When the eyes of the country are on the two of them -- and the 21 senators on the Judiciary Committee -- it's impossible to predict the final outcome.

"SEOUL, South Korea — South Korea successfully test-fired on Friday a new ballistic missile with a range far enough to hit any part of North Korea, as it seeks to counter the North’s growing missile threat. While President Moon Jae-in watched, the weapon, a type of Hyunmoo-2 ballistic missile, blasted off from a test site in Taean, a coastal county southwest of Seoul, the capital, the president’s office said in a statement. The missile traveled a designated distance before hitting a target, the office said, without disclosing how far it flew. Defense officials and the domestic news media said the missile could fly up to 800 kilometers, or 497 miles — the maximum ballistic missile range allowed under a deal with the United States. South Korea has tested the missile four times so far and will have it ready to use after two additional tests, Mr. Moon’s office said. Mr. Moon, since winning the election last month, has vowed to pursue talks with North Korea, insisting that sanctions alone have failed to persuade the North to stop its nuclear weapons program. He is scheduled to meet with President Trump in Washington this month to discuss a joint strategy on how to stop the North’s pursuit of nuclear weapons. “I am a believer in dialogue, but I also know that dialogue is possible when we have a strong national defense,” Mr. Moon was quoted as saying from the missile test site. “A policy of embracing North Korea is possible when we have a defense capability that surpasses that of North Korea.” The North has been stepping up its missile development in recent years. A series of tests that it has conducted have raised fears that it is bolstering its abilities to strike South Korea, Japan and American military bases in the Western Pacific. The North has also pledged to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile that could deliver a nuclear warhead to the continental United States. As that threat by the North has increased, South Korea has also sought to strengthen its abilities, particularly after the United States agreed in 2012 to let it possess ballistic missiles with a range of up to 497 miles, as long as the payload did not exceed 500 kilograms, about half a ton. South Korea can load warheads weighing up to two tons on ballistic missiles with shorter ranges. Until then, the South had been barred from deploying ballistic missiles with a range of more than 300 kilometers, or 186 miles, and a payload of more than half a ton because of concerns about a regional arms race. It first agreed to missile guidelines with the United States in 1979 in return for American technological aid in developing its first ballistic missiles. But South Korea’s desire to improve its weaponry gained urgency as the North made gains in its missile programs. South Korea’s ballistic-missile inventory includes the Hyunmoo-2A with a range of 186 miles and the Hyunmoo-2B with a range of 310 miles. Its Agency for Defense Development test-fired the Hyunmoo-2B from a mobile launch vehicle at the Taean site in 2015, as observed by Park Geun-hye, the president at the time. The new missile on Friday was believed to be named Hyunmoo-2C. On Friday evening, a North Korean soldier defected to the South, walking across the central section of the heavily guarded inter-Korean border, the South Korean military and news media reported. Officials were questioning him to find out his motive. The soldier, whose name and rank were not disclosed pending investigation, was the second North Korean soldier to defect across the inter-Korean land border in 10 days. Although more than 30,000 North Koreans have fled to the South since the early 1990s, defections across the North-South border are uncommon. Most defectors travel first through China and Southeast Asia before reaching the South. North Korean soldiers who had defected in the past often said they had fled hunger or abuse in their front-line units. They also said they were enticed by South Korean propaganda broadcasts along the border that urged North Korean troops to defect for a better life in the South.","South Korea Test-Fires New Ballistic Missile, Far Enough to Hit Any Part of North",South Korea Tests New Ballistic Missile with Range Far Enough to Hit North Korea,South Korea Test-fires Ballistic Missile with a Range Far Far Enough to Hit North Korea,10,10,10,9,9,9,1,10,8
"Editorial A weekend of official explanations for President Trump’s airstrikes on a Syrian air base has only deepened the confusion over his intentions, next steps and the legal basis for his unilateral use of force in the middle of that complicated, intractable civil war. The administration will have to do better than this. Presidents have an obligation to explain military operations to the American people and the world, and, when possible, most begin making their argument well before they take action. In Mr. Trump’s case, the need for clarity is even greater given that the attack on Thursday, in retaliation for President Bashar al-Assad’s use of chemical weapons on civilians, was a reversal of the position he campaigned on just months ago. Now that Mr. Trump has ordered a strike against the Assad government, how far is he prepared to go to end the six-year-old civil war? What does the operation say about his willingness to use force beyond Syria? One troublesome answer may be found in Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s comments on Monday. “We rededicate ourselves to holding to account any and all who commit crimes against the innocents anywhere in the world,” he said on a trip to a World War II memorial in Italy, a trip aimed at rallying allies and Russia around a strategy to end the Syrian war. His words could foreshadow an extraordinary expansion of American intervention. That would defy Mr. Trump’s campaign pledge to put “America First.” These and other comments added to confusion over whether the administration’s focus will be on ousting Mr. Assad or on sticking with Mr. Trump’s stated priority of defeating the Islamic State. Mr. Tillerson, on CBS’s “Face the Nation” on Sunday, said “we believe that the first priority is the defeat of ISIS.” Only after that threat is reduced or eliminated would he turn to a cease-fire process leading to elections so the Syrians could decide Mr. Assad’s fate, he said. The American ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, suggested Mr. Assad’s ouster would have to come before a political transition. “There’s not any sort of option where a political solution is going to happen with Assad at the head of the regime,” she said on CNN. On NBC’s “Meet the Press,” she said there could be other priorities, like getting Iran out of Syria, which would put the United States in direct conflict with one of Mr. Assad’s main backers. H. R. McMaster, the national security adviser, tried to paper over the differences on Fox News, but while he put more emphases on defeating ISIS, he also said the administration might take further action against Mr. Assad including for the use of conventional weapons. There is also confusion over the strikes’ legality. Whether they were a one-off attack designed to deter chemical weapons use or the start of a larger operation, Mr. Trump has failed to make a compelling legal case, or obtain proper international and congressional authorization, for attacking a sovereign nation. The White House issued a statement suggesting the attack complied with international law because Mr. Assad violated an international chemical weapons treaty and caused severe humanitarian distress. But Mr. Trump did not seek authorization from the Security Council to use force, as the United Nations Charter requires, or have a valid reason for acting in self-defense. The statement also suggested Mr. Trump’s action complied with American law because of his powers under Article II of the Constitution to defend national interests by force. President Barack Obama used the same vague argument to justify the Libya intervention of 2011, though many legal experts questioned it then and still do. Too often in recent years, presidents have taken military action without the authorization of Congress, which shares war-making responsibilities with the president. It is essential that Congress consider a new authorization for the use of military force in Syria both to demonstrate the need for legal justification for military action and to ensure a full vetting of Mr. Trump’s intentions there.",Opinion | How Far Is Trump Ready to Go to End Syria?,Opinion | How Far Is Trump Preparing to Use Force?,"Trump Orders Strikes on Syrian Air Base, but Not U.N.

"Asheville, North Carolina (CNN)Police issued a warrant Tuesday for the arrest of a man whom reporters witnessed grabbing a protester by the neck and apparently hitting him in the face during a Donald Trump campaign rally. The Asheville Police Department issued a warrant for Thomas Vellanti Jr.'s arrest on Tuesday morning after footage of the altercation on Monday, which the police department called an ""assault,"" circulated on social media and in national news reports. ""This morning, the Asheville Police Department followed up on the incident and obtained warrants for the suspect, Thomas Vellanti Jr.,"" the police department said in a statement. ""The Asheville Police Department worked diligently to protect both those attending the rally and those exercising their right to protest."" ""APD has taken out warrants on Thomas Vellanti Jr. for the assault which was caught on video last night at the Donald Trump Rally. #AVLPD,"" the police department tweeted Tuesday. The Trump campaign has not answered requests for comment. A call to Vellanti also went unanswered. A CNN reporter saw Vellanti accosting a group of eight protesters who began shouting in the middle of Trump's rally and exchanged words with one man before grabbing him by the neck while brandishing his closed fist. Vellanti then appeared to swing at the protester, but it's unclear if the protester dodged the punch. Police officers, who were stationed throughout the arena of Trump's rally, were not involved in the incident and Vellanti remained at the rally. The incident on Monday came as Trump lambasted Hillary Clinton for calling half of his supporters a ""basket of deplorables,"" accusing her of running a ""hate-filled"" campaign. And moments earlier, Trump had brought a group of supporters on stage, proclaiming them hard-working Americans, not ""deplorables."" Clinton has said she regretted saying the word ""half,"" but said she will continue to call out the ""bigotry"" in the Trump campaign. Reporters also witnessed Vellanti trying to grab a female protester who was also being escorted out of the building. And when a woman in a hijab tried to sit down as the group of protesters were ejected, the man shouted, ""Get out!"" and motioned for her to leave. After the protesters were ejected, Vellanti extended his arms, raising his clenched fists like a victorious boxer. The incidents occurred as a Trump campaign staffer arrived by the group of protesters to escort them out of the rally. The staffer did not ask the supporter to leave the rally. Past incidents of violence The altercation is not the first incident of violence at a Trump rally. A Trump supporter in Fayetteville, North Carolina, was charged with assault in March after he punched a protester as he was being escorted from the venue by police. Trump later suggested he might pay for the man's legal bills. And last fall, a Black Lives Matter protester was tackled, punched and kicked by a Trump supporter at a rally in Birmingham, Alabama. Trump later said that man maybe ""should have been roughed up."" Trump has also been accused of stoking violence at his rallies, telling supporters during a February rally that he'd ""like to punch him (a protester) in the face."" ""In the old days,"" Trump added then, protesters would be ""carried out on a stretcher."" But Trump has sought to mollify the tone of his campaign, saying at more recent rallies that his supporters should be non-violent toward protesters. As he slammed Clinton for saying that half of his supporters are ""racist, sexist, homophobic, xenophobic, Islamophobic,"" Trump argued that every American deserves ""leadership that honors you, cherishes you and totally defends you."" ""Every American is entitled to be treated with dignity and respect in our country,"" he said.

"Mr. Cuomo is the governor of New York. The Trump administration’s inhumane treatment of immigrant children has left a dark stain on the history of our nation. It is a human tragedy and a threat to our values. On Wednesday, President Trump signed an executive order rolling back his own policy of separating parents from their children — claiming to solve a problem that was of his own creation. But this order is no solution at all. It still leaves open the long-term detention of immigrant children, which would clearly violate federal law. Moreover, you can’t un-abuse the more than 2,300 children who have been separated from their parents at the border with the swipe of a pen. The administration’s family separation policy has already done potentially irreparable harm to those children who were used as pawns in the president’s political agenda. And the order includes no plan to reunite these children with their parents, something that should be done as quickly as possible. The potential toll on these children is heavy. Research shows that the trauma of forced separation can cause long-lasting physical and emotional effects on children, changing how they process information, react to stress and develop executive function and decision-making skills. Such stress could also make these children more prone to inflammation and disease as they grow to be adults. As the number of adverse childhood events increases, the risk of health problems such as obesity, alcoholism and depression later in life increases. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo seemed to defend the policy by praising the resilience of refugees this week. But in fact, by separating such young children from their parents, the federal government may have undermined that argument: Research shows that trauma can inhibit the development of resilience. To make matters worse, the federal government is prohibiting New York from providing health and mental health services to the hundreds of children who have already been placed by the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement in centers around the state — even though the state regulates those centers. The facilities in New York are a testament to the love and compassion of our residents, providing high-quality care and homelike settings that contrast with the terrifying tent city and refurbished Walmart being used to house detainees along the border. But these children shouldn’t be in facilities in New York or anywhere else in the first place. They should be with their parents. The mistreatment of children seeking refuge within our borders is a moral outrage and an affront to the teachings of every major religion. “All tyranny needs to gain a foothold,” it has been said, “is for people of good conscience to remain silent.” New York will not remain silent. Our state has always served as a beacon of liberty and opportunity for the world, and the Lady of the Harbor holds her torch high not only to light the way for immigrants, but to light the way forward when our country is lost. This week, I announced New York State’s intent to file a multiagency lawsuit against the Trump administration to swiftly reunite children with their parents and put an end to the abuse of immigrant families. We fully intend to move forward with this suit to prevent any further harm to the children in custody. Our case rests primarily on three claims. First, that holding the children apart from their families is a violation of the constitutional rights of parents to care for, maintain custody of and communicate with their children. These parents are afforded the fundamental right to family integrity under the United States Constitution and under the New York State Constitution. By systematically separating parents from their children, this administration has shown complete disregard for parental rights. Second, that detaining children — alone or even with their families for an extended period of time — is a violation of the terms of the 1997 Flores settlement agreement with the federal government, which set national standards regarding the detention, release and treatment of children in immigration detention. The settlement, which the administration is seeking to modify, prioritizes the principle of family unity, requires juvenile immigrant detainees to be released within 20 days, and explicitly requires family reunification with a clear preference for parental custody. Third, we intend to invoke what is known as the “outrageous government conduct doctrine.” In a 1973 case, United States v. Russell, the Supreme Court wrote that it “may someday be presented with a situation in which the conduct of law enforcement agents is so outrageous that due process principles would absolutely bar the government from invoking judicial processes to obtain a conviction.” That day has come. The callous tactics used by Immigration and Customs Enforcement have no place in this country. We cannot wash away this stain on American history. But we are not without a voice, and will speak up for the voiceless, with words and with action. We will not let what has been done go unanswered, and we will do everything we can to ensure that it never happens again. Together, we can reaffirm our commitment to the fundamental values that built this state and this nation.",Opinion | The Trump Administration’s ‘Inhumane’ Treatment of Immigrant Children,Opinion | New York’s Fight Against Trump’S Family Separation Policy,Cuomo: Trump Administration’s Inhumane Treatment of Immigrant Children Has Left a Dark stain on our Nation,8,9,3,6,8,5,9,9,1
" (CNN)President Donald Trump's main hope for reelection has been the economy. As I noted earlier this week, Trump's approval on the economy has averaged 53% over CNN's last three polls. His overall job approval rating in those same polls among voters has been just 44%.  But what happens if the economy loses some steam? Some indicators, such as the yield curve, suggest this could occur. Trump's already shaky reelection chances would likely drop significantly.  Right now, the main reason voters approve of Trump's job performance is the economy. A CNN poll from late May found that 26% of those who approve of Trump's job performance said it was mainly because of the economy. That was more than double the next most commonly given answer. Additionally, 8% said jobs/unemployment was the main reason for why they approved of Trump. Among those who disapproved, few said anything related to the economy was the main reason why they disapproved of Trump. For example, only 1% said the Trump tax cuts.  Now, many of those who approve of Trump currently would approve of him regardless of what he did. Still, he'd probably lose some of those who approve if the economy went south. He cannot afford for that to happen. At just 44% approval overall, Trump needs a few lucky breaks even if the economy stays steady. Further, a dip in the economy would probably lose Trump any shot he had at winning over that 9% of voters who approve of him on the economy but not overall. Remember that when there were signs of an economic slowdown during the government shutdown earlier this year, Trump's approval rating dropped to about 40% with all voters.  Trump's reelection chances could hinge on the state of the economy. Take, for example, job growth.  Job growth is a simple measure and fairly predictive of an incumbent's reelection hopes. I took a weighted yearly average (i.e. from October to October) for each of the final two years before the election and compared this measure to the president's reelection margin in presidential elections dating back to the end of World War II. I say weighted because the growth the year before the election is weighted more heavily.  Applying this to Trump, we find that the average weighted yearly job growth over the last two years has been about 1.5%. This is the type of growth that is consistent with a close reelection margin. Two incumbents with similar job growth over their final two years (George W. Bush in 2004 at 1.1% and Barack Obama in 2012 at 1.6%) won by less than 4 points.  Of course, Trump's current level of job growth is far from a guarantee of winning reelection. Gerald Ford had a nearby 1.9% yearly weighted average growth over his final two years, and he lost by 2 points. It makes sense that job growth isn't a perfect predictor of reelection fortune. Beyond the basic fact that there are plenty of ways to measure the economy, there are issues voters consider besides the economy. For Ford, it was Watergate. For Trump, our May poll suggests it's likely the issues surrounding his character. The state of the economy suggests a range of possible outcomes from moderate sized loss to moderate sized win. That range of possibilities for Trump becomes a lot more dire if the economy takes a turn for the south. Let's say yearly job growth gets cut in half. That would mean a weighted yearly job growth of less than 1.0%. The only two incumbents running for reelection to face that type of economy since the end of World War II were Jimmy Carter in 1980 and George H.W. Bush in 1992. Both lost by more than 5 points.  In other words, even if voters dismissed concerns about his character, Trump would be an underdog if the economy slides. For character concerns not to cause Trump trouble, he would probably need yearly job growth to double. That would lift Trump's economy to fit the average of presidents who won reelection by 15 points or more (Dwight Eisenhower in 1956, Lyndon Johnson in 1964, Richard Nixon in 1972 and Ronald Reagan in 1984).  Right now, however, Trump would probably be happy if the economy just stayed the course.

"As the world has adopted social media, activists have too, and it appears that the Facebook-owned Instagram has unwittingly become one of the most robust platforms for online activism. Instagram was sold for billions back in 2012, which could be viewed as a shady form of wealth consolidation. As a corporate entity that runs ads for profit, Instagram does not readily correspond with humanitarian or philanthropic work, and has faced troubling criticism for censorship and online harassment. Not to mention, Instagram has gained a reputation as the platform of choice for celebrities, selfies, and general vapidity. And isn't narcissism the opposite of advocacy? Those that think Instagram is just for #fitspo, hot dog legs, and relationship goals are missing the bigger picture beyond that pretty Valencia filter. Instead, individuals and organizations are using Instagram to support and grow their cause in ways that make perfect sense in our highly-visual, tech-driven world. The very reasons that Instagram can be infuriating also lend it strength. While it may not inherently be a force for good, in the hands of the right people it can be a dynamic organizing tool.  With 700 million monthly users as of this year—more than 90 percent under age 35—Instagram averages four times more engagement than even Facebook, most notably for brands and celebrities. Twitter, the only other hashtag-based platform, has been growing much slower than its competitors.Millennials and Generation Z use it the most, so demographics that represent the future are already using Instagram and are both politically and socially charged. What makes Instagram different from other platforms is its focus on image-sharing first and foremost, with video content becoming increasingly common. While visuals can certainly be vacuous and cliche, such criticisms underestimate what imagery can achieve.There's a reason why Instagram resonates so strongly: imagery is powerful. Pictures are about showing rather than telling, and are far more emotionally charged than a gigantic block of text. Take the Instagram account Goats of Anarchy. The animal sanctuary and corresponding nonprofit is run by Leanne Lauricella, who rescues and rehabilitates handicapped or abused goats, among other animals. Followers love daily pictures and videos of beloved critters who often sport wheels to aid their mobility. Instagram has the ability to capture and share raw and real photos and videos, evoking emotion without dilution. Whether you are showing polar bears jeopardized by a fragile ecosystem, like NatGeo's Paul Nicklen, or children receiving education the world over, like educator Rebecca Ume Crook, pictures really are worth a thousand words, and videos even more. Sure enough, larger nonprofit organizations and charities are catching onto this trend. In 2011, Jamie Henn, communications director for the environmental activist group 350.org, explained this shift in an interview with the Chronicle of Philanthropy. ""By using images and video,"" he said, ""we have been able to convey stories with emotional impact in a very different way."" Users fire up the app for customized experiences where they can follow real people. Instagram practically created the concept of ""influencers"" and reinforces the power of the individual to enact direct change. Some of the most impactful accounts on Instagram belong to individuals, not brands. Such users build audiences and connections, making social responsibility aspirational. Celebrities wield huge power on this platform and often use it to advocate for charities they care about. Emma Watson is a great example of this theory in action. An ambassador for the feminist HeforShe Initiative, Watson has used her personal Instagram to advocate for everything from gender equality to sustainable design. The platform has elevated various movements, feminism and its many facets chief among them. From body positivity advocates like Iskra Lawrence, who creates snarky visuals to clap back at body shaming, to Alexandra Elle, whose poetry and portraits affirm black, female identity, women especially are using Instagram to share their causes with the masses. The popularity of hashtags like #effyourbeautystandards (promoting body positivity) and #arthoe (feminist art created by and for people of color) demonstrates how advocacy initiatives continue to gain power organically. As social media evolves, so too does the way features can work for its socially conscious users. Activists can now, in theory, stream their protests live. Users can save photos promoting fundraising events so they can check in on the details later. People all over the world can connect and share their passions and stories with less lag time than ever, promoting global worldviews that could prompt large-scale awareness and change. Everyday users can follow and participate in existing movements or promote nonprofits they are passionate about using photos, videos, and hashtags—or even better, start an account dedicated to a cause of your own design. So long as Instagram keeps appealing to and serving activists, we can expect its use for advocacy to grow too. Running your cause through a filter may seem trite, but all signs point to power in tech, numbers, and visuals.

"Communication planet Mercury, which is currently in Aquarius, connects with one of your planetary rulers, Mars, on February 3, finding you being proactive around having conversations concerning money and security (both financial and emotional). This is a wise time to plan strategies, little scorpion. Venus enters fellow Water sign Pisces on February 10, illuminating the romance and creativity sector of your chart. This is a fantastic time to flirt with your crushes, make art, and generally have fun. As more planets move into Pisces this month—Mercury does so on February 17, followed by the Sun on February 18—more and more focus will shift to this fun, flirtatious sector of your chart. You'll find yourself on questions like who and what makes your heart sing? Plain and simple: Are you having enough joy in your life, little scorpion? Are you letting yourself have a good time? Are you exploring your creative talents, and sharing your creations with the people you care about? One of the dreamiest, most romantic days of the month is February 21, when Venus will meet Neptune in Pisces, creating a whimsical vibe in your love life and provoking a huge burst of creative inspiration within you. A solar eclipse—a mega new moon with a fated air about it—in Aquarius arrives on February 15, bringing big shake-ups to your home. The energy will be emotional and exhausting, so don’t plan any important meetings if you can help it, and try to sleep in if you can. All eclipses are emotional; however, you’ll feel a prominent pang of nostalgia during this one. Secrets and surprises from your deep past, early childhood, or even from further back in your family’s history may resurface. As turbulent as the air may be, everything that comes up for you now is coming up so you can heal, process the emotions, and move forward. The purpose of all eclipses is to put us back on our correct path, especially if we've been veering from it and focusing on things and people that do not deserve our attention. On a mundane level, you simply could be moving or making big changes to your home at this time. Emotionally, redefining what family means to you is certainly a big theme, as is getting clear on your boundaries. You’re a private person, Scorpio, and you’ll particularly feel this way during this eclipse. Supportive energy will be in the air during this eclipse, as communication planet Mercury will connect with the planet of genius, Uranus, encouraging quick problem-solving and finding you coming up with some neat life-hacks. Venus will also connect with Saturn, in grounded Earth sign Capricorn, promoting thoughtful, mature communication and encouraging people to be mindful about planning for the future. Mars squares off with Neptune on February 17, which will be a low energy day. Don’t plan an important meeting or fancy date on this date! Fears and paranoid thoughts may occur, and you tend to be obsessive, so keep unhelpful negative thinking in check. Surround yourself with supportive people you can vent to and who can help you stay grounded. Big, passionate energy arrives later this month when Venus squares off with Mars on February 25, and connects with Pluto on February 27. You want to feel valued and understood by the people you partner with, both romantically and creatively, and these days will present opportunities for you to explore these issues. The month opened with Mercury contacting one of your planetary rulers, Mars, and it closes that way, too, connecting with Pluto on February 28, finding you gaining access to hidden or exclusive information. You love secrets, Scorpio, so this should certainly be an exciting time for you! See you in March, little scorpion!","Scorpio, February 2018","Scorpio, February 2018","Daily Horoscope: February 15, 2019",9,9,9,2,2,10,7,7,10
