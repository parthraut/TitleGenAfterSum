" (CNN)Capitol Police arrested 87 protesters demonstrating in support of an expiring immigration program Monday, authorities told reporters, organized around a symbolic deadline for the end of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. There were two demonstrations on Capitol Hill. Police say 68 people were arrested in a protest that blocked traffic near the Capitol, at Independence and New Jersey avenues. The protesters there chained themselves together and lay down in the street. Officers cut off the chains, and took the protesters to waiting police vans. They were charged with ""crowding, obstructing or incommoding""; 28 of them were also charged with resisting arrest.  Nineteen others were arrested for a demonstration in the Longworth House Office Building, trying to get into the office of House Speaker Paul Ryan. The protest on Independence Avenue was peaceful. Capitol Police loaded some of the demonstrators into a police van, and then a second larger vehicle, similar to a shuttle bus, came for the rest. There were between 50 and 60 officers outside with the protesters, some surrounding the center group (who were ultimately arrested) and others keeping the rest of the protesters on the street corners. The group chanted ""Undocumented! Unafraid!"" in both English and Spanish. When the vehicles with those arrested departed, the group returned to the lawn between the Capitol and the Library of Congress, where they had earlier spelled out the word UNAFRAID in tissue paper flowers facing the Capitol. President Donald Trump ended the DACA policy in September, originally giving Congress a six month window to come up with a solution for what happens to those participants in the program. Multiple federal judges ruled that the justification the Trump administration was using to terminate the program was shaky at best -- and ordered the Department of Homeland Security to resume renewing all existing DACA permits. And the Supreme Court declined the administration's unusual request to leapfrog the appellate courts and consider immediately whether to overrule those decisions. Those court rulings have rendered the so-called deadline largely meaningless, as the program continues indefinitely pending further court action. Congressional efforts earlier this year to find a legislative solution on immigration have been unable to reach a resolution.

"It's a challenge getting bipedal robots to walk on their own. But now a group of electrical engineers and computer scientists have created a robot that walks by itself while keeping upright in snowy, uneven, and slippery conditions. And here's the kicker: It can't see. The group's robot, dubbed MARLO, is a top-heavy box on stilts with no vision that walks in much the same way as a toddler does. But still, these are pretty exciting times as most previous attempts to get bipedal robots to walk unaided have been desperately surreal, or resulted in snail-pace locomotion. ""The robot has no feeling in her tiny feet, but she senses the angles of her joints—for instance, her knee angles, hip angles and the rotation angle of her torso,"" Jessy Grizzle, professor of electrical engineering and computer science and of mechanical engineering from the University of Michigan, said in a press release.  To move MARLO, the researchers used mathematical modelling to create 15 walking styles that could handle different speeds and types of terrain. They applied these to MARLO, giving commands from an Xbox controller on how quickly and in what direction the robot should walk. However, it's up to MARLO, which has onboard feedback algorithms, to process its environment and adapt its gait accordingly. For the moment, MARLO can move smoothly on plywood squares and bumpy astroturf as long as it doesn't have to make any sudden turns. Improvements in the algorithms feedback ability are required for greater agility—something the group are currently working on. What makes this research interesting is the future potential to apply the algorithms developed for MARLO to other robots, and to people with prosthetic legs. Robert Gregg, an assistant professor of mechanical engineering and bioengineering at the University of Texas-Dallas, for example, has already gotten started: He has adapted the research group's algorithm to control a prosthetic lower leg.  ""We hope to encode similar abilities into our robotic prosthetic leg so that lower-limb amputees can just as easily walk about the community without having to think about the terrain,"" said Gregg, in a press release.",This Robot Can Walk by Its Own Hand,This Robot Can Walk on Its Own,This Robot Can Walk by itself,8,10,8,7,8,7,8,9,8
"Fact Check of the Day President Trump claimed that Senate and House candidates he endorses will always win. But four candidates he has backed have lost their races. what was said After Tuesday’s elections, President Trump cherry-picked results to make the case that his endorsement always produces victories for candidates. While candidates backed by Mr. Trump in Republican primaries have almost always won, four of his endorsed candidates have lost their elections. Republican voters did choose four out of the five candidates Mr. Trump backed in Tuesday’s primary elections. The fifth — Kris Kobach, the Kansas secretary of state who is running for governor — is also leading in the polls, but the race is too close to call. In Ohio’s special congressional election, Troy Balderson, whom Mr. Trump endorsed in July, is leading his Democratic opponent by a razor-thin margin, but The New York Times and other news outlets have yet to declare a winner. Beyond Tuesday’s elections, Mr. Trump has endorsed at least 18 other winning candidates in primary elections. But Republican voters rejected one of his picks: Luther Strange, who ran for the party’s nomination in Alabama’s Senate election last year. Several of Mr. Trump’s endorsed Republican candidates — like Representative Karen Handel of Georgia, Representative Ron Estes of Kansas, Representative Greg Gianforte of Montana and Representative Ralph Norman of South Carolina — won special elections against Democrats last year. But three — Roy S. Moore in Alabama’s Senate race, Rick Saccone in a special Pennsylvania congressional race and Ed Gillespie in the Virginia governor’s race — lost their bids against Democrats. Mr. Trump also encouraged his supporters to vote for Representative Kevin McCarthy of California and “all of the great GOP candidates for Congress” in the state’s primary elections in June. Under California law, the top two finishers advance to the general election, regardless of party. While Mr. McCarthy did finish first in his primary, Republican candidates failed to qualify for the general election in California’s Senate race and its 44th Congressional District.

"Washington (CNN)US Immigration and Customs Enforcement Acting Director Ron Vitiello will leave his leadership post at the end of the week, according to a letter sent to ICE employees Wednesday.  His announcement comes after his nomination to lead the agency in a permanent position was suddenly pulled by the White House last Thursday.  ""I am writing to let you know that Friday, April 12, 2019, will be my last day as Acting Director of U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE). I would also like to express my deep thanks and gratitude for the opportunity to serve with our incredible workforce,"" he wrote to employees in the letter, which was obtained by CNN. Vitiello, who appeared to be on the cusp of Senate confirmation, was nominated by President Donald Trump to head the agency in August. He previously served as chief of the US Border Patrol and acting deputy commissioner of Customs and Border Protection. Last Friday, President Donald Trump said he wanted to go in a ""tougher direction"" -- a move that came at the urging of White House senior adviser Stephen Miller. ""We're going in a little different direction. Ron's a good man but we're going in a tougher direction. We want to go in a tougher direction,"" Trump told reporters Friday at the White House. The surprise withdrawal of his nomination set off a week of uncertainty and major leadership change at the Department of Homeland Security, which oversees ICE.  By Sunday, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen announced her resignation, and on Wednesday acting DHS Deputy Secretary Claire Grady announced her resignation as well.  At least two other DHS officials were also been named as possibly heading out the door.

" (CNN)Rudy Giuliani will defy House Democrats' impeachment subpoena, a letter his attorney sent to Congress on Tuesday said. Jon Sale, Giuliani's attorney sent a letter to Congress informing them that Giuliani will not be providing documents that were requested by subpoena. The Office of Management and Budget also does not plan to turn over the documents that impeachment committees subpoenaed, a spokeswoman said, pointing to a letter earlier this month from White House counsel Pat Cipollone saying it speaks for OMB as well.  The White House letter slammed the impeachment investigation as ""constitutionally illegitimate"" and made clear the administration does not plan to cooperate.  Giuliani is also now parting ways with his personal attorney Jon Sale who has represented him in impeachment matters, Giuliani told CNN.  Sale will stop representing the former New York City mayor shortly, Giuliani told CNN. Sale had been working for Giuliani after the House of Representatives subpoenaed Giuliani for documents related to the ongoing impeachment inquiry.  ""Jon was helping me with assessing (the) congressional request. He will submit his letter and he will be finished with what I asked him to do,"" Giuliani said. People close to Giuliani are advising him to hire a criminal lawyer as questions linger about his connections to two of his associates, Lev Parnas and Igor Furman, who were indicted last week for campaign-finance violations. Giuliani, who is President Donald Trump's personal attorney, has been resisting that advice, according to those people. Giuliani did not directly answer whether he was looking to hire a new attorney for himself. ""If they take me to court I would then have to get another lawyer,"" he told CNN. Taking on a criminal attorney would likely cost Giuliani something close to $1 million, according to people in New York legal circles. That could be difficult for Giuliani, who admitted earlier this year that he had to take a $100,000 loan from another of Trump's lawyers Marc Mukasey as a result of his ongoing divorce proceedings, according to a report from Bloomberg.

"Photo by Andrew Segreti If you're still recovering from the dance rock fatigue of the past few years, Brooklyn trio Twin Wave are here to kick your butt back on the dance floor. The group offers up hip-shaking rhythms and melodies balanced by judicious use of synths that eschew New Wave cheese. Consider ""Matador,"" the lead single off of their forthcoming EP Pour Out the Dark, recorded at Brooklyn's Mission Sound under the guise of Tommy Eichmann (Alex Winston). The tune plays like a more cerebral love letter to Duran Duran, swapping in lyrics inspired by Hemingway's bullfighting-as-art passages in ""The Sun Also Rises"" for the genre's tired go-tos of hedonism and bombast. “The idea of bullfighting as an art form rather than a sport immediately struck me,"" says frontman Nick Williams. ""Seeing beauty and art and being mesmerized by that kind of exhibited violence stayed with me ever since, and it was the first thing that came into my head after Sarik and Maxx first wrote the guitar riff that leads the track.” Matador has more going on beneath its melodic surface, with rhythmic interplay that rewards repeat listens. That said, don't overthink it—press play and get to boogieing below. Twin Wave will play a single release show on Friday April 15 at Baby's All Right.

"COLOMBO, Feb 24 (Reuters) - Sri Lankan rupee forwards ended slightly weaker on Wednesday as importer demand for the greenback and mild dollar inflows put pressure on the rupee despite a 50-basis-point rate hike by the central bank last week. One-week rupee forwards, which act as a proxy for the spot currency, ended at 144.65/70 per dollar, compared with Tuesday’s close of 144.60/67. “The demand was there today and exporters are not converting dollars,” a currency dealer said, asking not to be named. “Still the policy uncertainty is there and there is also some speculation over inflows from borrowings.” The rupee will be under pressure with seasonal import demand picking up ahead of the local New Year season starting in April, another dealer said.

"Washington (CNN)Twice as many South Carolina Republicans submitted absentee ballots than did in 2008, election officials said Saturday, even as one large Republican county confronts some election challenges. The South Carolina State Elections Commission reports that it received a total of almost 78,000 absentee ballots in the Democratic and Republican primaries.  ""Record Absentee Numbers in #SCPrimary. Nearly 78,000 Absentee Ballots returned in Rep and Dem Primaries. More than double returned in '08,"" the elections account tweeted. While higher absentee totals do not always correlate to higher turnout overall, South Carolina GOP officials are expecting a record number of people to cast ballots in the state's Republican primary. ""Our online metrics and social media are through the roof. We had record turnout last time -- 607,000 people,"" South Carolina GOP chairman Matt Moore said earlier this week on CNN. ""I think it will be 650,000 to 700,000 people on Saturday."" Higher turnout on the Republican side is expected to favor Donald Trump, who has banked on drawing out less likely and first time voters in the Palmetto State. But Anderson County, in the heavily conservative Upstate region, officials reported problems with technology and election workers. One site reported a long line and only one laptop. Another had trouble recruiting poll managers to volunteer.  Katy Smith, the director of Anderson County Registration and Elections, said the county was partially unprepared for the crush of voters. ""We just ask people to be patient and kind. We want them to vote,"" she said in a statement. ""It just simply may take a little longer for such an important matter,"" And South Carolina's not the only contest where election observers are monitoring turnout.

"Washington (CNN)Physical hacking of airplane electrical systems is a realistic possibility that could bring down aircraft, the Department of Homeland Security warned Tuesday.   The government said researchers at a cybersecurity firm identified ways an attacker could cause aircraft displays to show false ""engine telemetry readings, compass and attitude data, altitude, airspeeds, and angle of attack.""   ""The researchers have further outlined that a pilot relying on instrument readings would be unable to distinguish between false and legitimate readings, which could result in loss of control of the affected aircraft,"" wrote the Cybersecurity and Infrastructure Security Agency, which is part of DHS.   Rapid7, the research firm, said it investigated the risks with small aircraft rather than larger commercial planes.   Hackers must have physical access to the aircraft, the company said. The attack involves physically plugging a malicious device into the electronics systems that increasingly control the displays and functions of modern aircraft.   Similar -- but more secure -- technology is used in cars. The Rapid7 researchers attributed that difference to the fact that ""even small, personal aircraft are rarely parked in unmonitored, open areas like open parking lots or public streets,"" as is the case for cars.    The DHS notice recommended that ""aircraft owners restrict access to planes to the best of their abilities"" and that manufacturers review the security of their electronic systems, and consider using protections similar to those used in cars.

"The actress Sheridan Smith has taken a leave of absence from the West End production of “Funny Girl,” the production’s publicists said Thursday, citing “stress and exhaustion” as the reasons for her departure. “Funny Girl” started its run at the Menier Chocolate Factory, and after strong sales, transferred to the West End in April. Ms. Smith earned wide praise for her performance in the role of Fanny Brice, a character that is strongly identified with Barbra Streisand, who played the part on Broadway and on the screen. In recent months Ms. Smith had drawn media attention for missing several performances of the show, and for a widely reported series of Twitter posts in which she seemed to voice frustration over personal issues. “U know when u suddenly realise U’re just a puppet,” read one post in February, according to The Telegraph. (Ms. Smith’s Twitter account has been made private.) She pulled out of several performances this week. When The Daily Mail suggested that she had missed Monday’s performance because she had lost out on a television BAFTA award on Sunday, Ms. Smith voiced her frustration in tweets directed at the media. The production’s publicist issued a statement on Thursday that read: “Sheridan Smith will be taking leave of absence from Funny Girl, due to stress and exhaustion. The entire team at Funny Girl is thinking of Sheridan, and know she is getting the rest and support she needs during this very difficult and stressful time.” Ms. Smith will be on leave for two to four weeks, the statement said.

"Fact Check of the Day It has happened at least 185 times in the past century. what was said the facts Gross domestic product increased at a 4.2 annualized rate in the second quarter of 2018, and the unemployment rate was 3.9 percent in April, 3.8 percent in May and 4.0 percent in June. But Mr. Trump is wrong that G.D.P. growth has not been higher than the unemployment rate in the past century. In fact, it has happened in 185 months since 1948, according to data from the Federal Reserve Bank of St. Louis. Most recently, in the first quarter of 2006, the gross domestic product grew at a rate of 5.4 percent, while the unemployment rate was 4.7 percent in January, 4.8 percent in February and 4.7 percent in March. The biggest positive gap between the quarterly gross domestic product growth rate and unemployment occurred in September 1950. At that time, the American jobless rate was 4.4 percent, and the gross domestic product increased at 16.5 percent in the third quarter — a difference of 12 points.

"Washington (CNN)Incoming Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Wednesday that Democrats will not work with Republicans to negotiate and pass a replacement for Obamacare once Republicans vote to repeal it.  ""If they repeal without a replacement, they will own it. Democrats will not then step up to the plate and come up with a half-baked solution that we will partially own. It's all theirs,"" Schumer told The Washington Post. The New York Democrat has previously stopped short of saying anything similar to that on the matter. He told CNN last week in a hallway interview with a warning for Republicans that repealing Obamacare could pose problems. Democrats plot tactics to thwart GOP Obamacare repeal ""They're going to find repealing Obamacare without putting in a replacement will be far more disastrous and less clever than they think. That's all I'm going to say,"" Schumer said at the time. Other Democratic leaders, including Sen. Patty Murray, told CNN that Democrats would make the GOP ""own"" a replacement bill. Retiring Democratic Leader Harry Reid said at a news conference Tuesday that Democrats would not be ""complicit"" on a replacement bill. The lack of Democratic cooperation is significant because while Republicans can repeal much of Obamacare with just 51 votes -- meaning without Democratic support -- to replace it, they will need 60 votes and therefore a handful of Democratic backers.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Tuesday repealing President Barack Obama's signature health care law is still ""the first item up in the new year."" ""Will there be challenges?

A lot of people want a Keurig-style beer machine. Last December, one homebrew system called Pico raised $1.4 million on Kickstarter, and SodaStream's stock popped 10 percent when their instant beer was announced. Anyone familiar with the other insta-brewing platforms out there—we're talking about coffee—knows that quality is often a compromise for convenience. The first to try the Blondie will be a body of discerning customers: The product will go on sale first in Switzerland and Germany, and will roll out in other markets later this year and in early 2017. Surely, the Germans won't be skeptical of a concentrated beer formula produced by a brewery in Italy, right? No word on how instant beer jibes with the Reinheitsgebot (aka the ""German Beer Purity Law""). SodaStream is selling a liter of Blondie formula (enough to produce three liters of beer) and two beer glasses for 10 euros, so you can pump out quite a few brews on the cheap.

" At the core of almost all the technologies you use on a daily basis are the electrical circuits that schlep electrons from point A to point B to deliver power to the device. These circuits need to be pretty small in order to fit in modern smartphones and computers, and are generally designed and manufactured to carry out a specific function.  But according to a team of physicists at Queen's University Belfast, the consumer and medical technologies of tomorrow will demand smaller, dynamic electrical circuits that would be impossible to create with current means. So in an effort to solve this dilemma, the researchers created an extremely thin electrically conducting sheet called a domain wall that is embedded within crystalline structures. The scientists are able to alter the domain wall, and the shape of the electrical circuit, without changing the structure of the crystal itself.  ""The tiniest devices are now composed of just a few atoms,"" Marty Gregg, a physicist at Queen's University, said. ""As things currently stand, it will become impossible to make these devices any smaller—we will simply run out of space. One solution is to make electronic circuits more 'flexible' so that they can exist at one moment for one purpose, but can be completely reconfigured the next moment for another purpose."" In other words, rather than trying to make smaller electrical circuits, Gregg and his colleagues focused on creating electrical circuits that could be drawn and redrawn in order to respond to the changing needs of the user—kind of like an electrical circuit Etch-a-Sketch.  The domain walls made by the Queen's University team are almost only a few atoms thick. This makes them almost as thin as graphene, the wonder material that can be used for everything from condoms to brain implants.   To create these tiny channels that are able to conduct electricity, the team used an ""acupuncture-like approach"" which squeezed the crystal's structure at specific locations using a special needle. The pressure from the needle creates what the researchers described as a ""jigsaw puzzle-like pattern of structural variants"" around the area where the needle made contact with the crystal. Once the domain walls are created, they can be moved around as desired by applying electrical fields to the crystal.  The research is an exciting proof-of-concept that the researchers hope will find use in creating the miniscule, programmable electrical circuits that will power the technology of tomorrow.",This Tiny Electrical Circuit Is Made of Just a few atoms,"Scientists Create Tiny, Tiny Electrical Circuits That Can Power the Future","Scientists Are Creating a Thin, Electrically Conducting Sheet",9,10,9,6,9,8,8,10,4
"The return of a blockbuster action franchise couldn’t bump “Black Panther” from the top of the box office this week. The Marvel movie earned another $27 million for its fifth straight week at No. 1, leaving “Tomb Raider” to settle for second place. “Black Panther” has now made $605 million domestically, making it the second-fastest movie to reach $600 million behind “Star Wars: The Force Awakens.” Globally, it has made $1.2 billion and sits in 14th place all time. But ticket sales fell steeply in its second weekend in China, where audiences complained about “political correctness.” The rebooted “Tomb Raider” earned $23.5 million in its first weekend, according to comScore, which compiles box office data. The Warner Bros. and Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer movie, which cost about $94 million to make, stars the Oscar-winning Alicia Vikander as the grim and acrobatic action hero Lara Croft. It barely performed better at the box office than 2003’s “Tomb Raider: Cradle of Life,” which starred Angelina Jolie and closed that era of the franchise. The reboot received tepid reviews and a B grade from ticket buyers in CinemaScore exit polls. The surprise hit of the week was Roadside Attractions’ “I Can Only Imagine,” which opened to a strong $17 million in just 1,629 locations (compared to 3,854 for “Black Panther”), easily making back its budget. The film stars Dennis Quaid and depicts the back story behind the song of the same name by the Christian band MercyMe. The marketing team made a strong push on Christian radio and at church events, resulting in a large audience driven by women and moviegoers over 35; the film received an A+ CinemaScore grade, suggesting it may continue to thrive from word of mouth. “Love, Simon,” a teen movie from Fox with a gay protagonist, performed decently with $11.7 million.

LaBeouf has had some run-ins with Trump supporters and, since Monday, police have been posted up outside his location at the Museum of Moving Images in New York. Last night, though, LaBeouf allegedly got into an altercation with a pro-Trump supporter. According to TMZ and other media outlets, a protestor walked in front of the livestream, seemingly agreeable and friendly to LaBeouf, and said ""Hitler did nothing wrong."" Factually incorrect and deeply stupid, but there you have it: this is our world now. LaBeouf got rightfully pissed off and shoved the guy aside, walking away. The pro-Nazi person alleges that LaBeouf grabbed him by the scarf and scratched him in the process. The protest is still going on, even without LaBeouf.

" If you’re interested in applying for a new job, the experts at Glassdoor suggest that you should start by researching the company that you’d like to work for, do some advance networking by reaching out to current employees, and make sure that your social media profiles present the best version of yourself. Those are all good tips, but they should probably specify that “reaching out” doesn’t mean “physically assaulting your potential manager.” Last Saturday, Joseph Ristick walked into the Taco Bell in Gresham, Oregon to complain about the sluggish service in the drive-thru line. According to the Gresham Police Department, the manager on duty told Ristick that the customer who was sitting at the window hadn’t completed his or her order. (“They do have a large array of tacos and delicious drinks after all,” the cops wrote in a Facebook post.) That’s when the 35-year-old allegedly turned violent, yelling and berating other customers in the restaurant before assaulting the manager. (That is not the spirit of Living Más!) The police were called to the scene, and although Ristick fled on foot, they were able to quickly locate him. He told the arresting officer that he had gone into the restaurant to get a job application “because they clearly needed help.” Weirdly enough, the manager was interested in sitting across from Ristick, asking him to detail his career goals or list two of his weaknesses. (Behaving in public seems to be one of them). Ristick was booked into jail on charges of assault in the fourth degree, as well as charges related to an outstanding warrant. “Clearly Ristick would go through great lengths to get someone a quick and tasty taco but pretty sure he’s not getting an interview anytime soon,” the police department joked. Fortunately for Ristick, there are three more Taco Bells in the Gresham area. Maybe he can reevaluate the meaning of “reaching out” and get that job application after all.

" (CNN)Defense Secretary James Mattis told reporters Friday that the administration is ""close"" to finalizing a plan going forward in Afghanistan. He stressed that putting together an overall strategy ""takes time"" and added, ""this is hard work so you've got to get it right, that's all there is to it and we are working to get it right."" Mattis had said on several previous occasions that a decision would come by mid-July. When asked by reporters if the delay is because of political issues, he replied: ""I hope it's a political decision. You fight wars for a reason."" Mattis added, ""once you get the policy right then you have to get the strategy right."" Mattis insisted that there is no stalemate in Afghanistan. ""It's not like we just stalled out here ... We have changed what we're doing. But I have not used the authority that has been granted to me, I'm going to figure it out before we — last thing I want to do is send troops in there and find I sent troops in for something I just canceled, these troops go in harm's way so you have to be careful."" Two defense officials close to the discussion on Afghanistan policy tell CNN that the top US commander for Afghanistan, Gen. John Nicholson is likely to get what he is requesting. The officials say that an additional 3,000 to 4,000 more troops are likely to be sent to the country. However, the officials caution that no final decision has been made.   What remains unclear is whether the troop increase would involve sending additional US forces or just topping off the unfulfilled NATO requirement from US allies. Mattis acknowledged how precious forces are for the US and allies: ""There will be some allies who are willing to send more troops. We are aware of that. But again their troops are as precious to them as ours are to us so we've got to get this thing right."" Approximately 8,000 US troops are currently in Afghanistan. Mattis also hinted that an official troop number increase may not be made public, ""I think we'll certainly give the framing principles. Wherever we can give the plan in a way that doesn't jeopardize the lives or the mission, we'll do it. I don't want to tell the enemy that (how many troops). ...  You know me I am always going to be conservative, if it's going to endanger the troops: nope, not going to talk about it.""

"C.E. Morgan, Susan Faludi and Jason Reynolds were honored on Thursday at the third annual Kirkus Prizes ceremony in Austin, Tex. Each prize comes with an award of $50,000. Ms. Morgan won the fiction prize for her second novel, “The Sport of Kings,” a sprawling story about horse racing, a family in Kentucky and race in America. In The Times, Dwight Garner called it a “ravishing and ambitious” book, “a mud-flecked epic, replete with fertile symbolism, that hurtles through generations of Kentucky history.” Ms. Faludi took home the nonfiction prize for “In the Darkroom,” a memoir about her father, who had sex reassignment surgery and sent Ms. Faludi the news after the two had barely spoken for 25 years. In The Times, Jennifer Senior wrote: “‘In the Darkroom’ is an absolute stunner of a memoir — probing, steel-nerved, moving in ways you’d never expect. Ms. Faludi is determined both to demystify the father of her youth — ‘a simultaneously inscrutable and volatile presence, a black box and a detonator’ — and to re-examine the very notion and nature of identity.” The young readers’ literature prize went to Jason Reynolds, for “As Brave As You,” in which an 11-year-old boy named Genie visits his grandparents in Virginia and learns about his African-American grandfather’s childhood during the Jim Crow era. In The New York Times Book Review, Lisa Graff wrote: “Genie can come across as a bit naïve, and his adventures … are rather tame. Still, it is hard not to cheer as, in his quiet way, he forges his own course, navigating the fine line between fear and cowardice.”","C.E.

"When you purchase a ticket for an independently reviewed film through our site, we earn an affiliate commission. Like the 1995 picture “Dead Man Walking,” “Trial by Fire” was created by filmmakers who believe that capital punishment is barbaric both as policy and in practice. This fact-based film takes the argument a step further in its details: While “Walking” was about a confessed killer who sought spiritual redemption, “Trial by Fire” details the state killing of a man many believe to have been innocent of the crime for which he was convicted. The man was Cameron Todd Willingham, who was found guilty of killing his three daughters by arson in 1991. Some time before his execution in 2004, various authorities were presented with evidence that the fire had not been set by Willingham and that his protests of innocence were sincere. Directed by Edward Zwick (“Glory,” “The Last Samurai,” and more recently, “Jack Reacher: Never Go Back”) from a script by Geoffrey Fletcher (“Precious”), the movie is based on a New Yorker article by David Grann. The story as told by Grann is detailed and linear, in a prose style both spare and refined. The dramatization hems and haws, incorporating flashbacks, fantasy sequences and other features intended to add intrigue to the narrative and depth to the characterizations. They wind up feeling like window-dressing, though. Expertly acted throughout — Jack O’Connell does his level best to make Willingham more than the standard-issue Hollywood Complex Roughneck, while Laura Dern, as a prison pen pal who becomes a defense ally, is a reliably elevating presence — the movie’s raw facts are sufficient to rouse viewer indignation. But the material arguably calls for a more proactively provocative approach. Where are old-school cinematic firebrands like Sam Fuller or Phil Karlson when you need them?

"Former FIFA president Sepp Blatter, former FIFA secretary general Jerome Valcke, and former finance director Markus Kattner awarded themselves upwards of $80 million in pay raises and World Cup bonuses, just in the last five years alone, lawyers for FIFA revealed on Friday through a FIFA press release. The news of obscene salaries and bonuses at the not-for-profit come as little surprise for those who have been anticipating further evidence in the criminal proceedings opened against Blatter last September, Valcke's in March, and after Kattner's dismissal last week. The only matter was just how much money was being funneled into their pockets. The spreadsheet outlining their bonuses and pay raises—released by FIFA today—reads as a farcical account of money changing hands between a scant five signatories: Blatter, Valcke, Kattner, former FIFA vice president Julio Grodona, and even Blatter's replacement as acting FIFA president after allegations, Issa Hayatou. Perhaps a more obscure line item is recently resigned audit chairman, Domenico Scala, who was in charge of overseeing FIFA reform, signed off on a contract extension for finance director Kattner through 2023—only four days after the U.S. indicted FIFA for heinous corruption allegations on May 27. The FIFA spreadsheet even accounted for, ""Clauses regarding special termination pay in the event of a termination for cause and the indemnification clause as set forth in Amendment III of April 30, 2011 continue to apply."" Basically, a green light to give an obscene amount of severance pay even for just-cause firings. In FIFA's press release, they stated dryly: Something else noteworthy: current President Gianni Infantino was eager to throw Scala under the bus after Scala condemned Infantino for alleged corruption, including rejecting a proposed $2 million salary. And yes, this is all happening three weeks after Infantino announced that ""the crisis is over.""

"London (CNN)President Donald Trump and first lady Melania Trump were tasked with a near-impossible question leading up to their rare state visit to the United Kingdom: What kind of hostess gift do you bring the Queen?  The process requires thought, attention to detail, coordination with the State Department, and adhering to the highest levels of protocol, and it appears they delivered. Finding the best gifts can be complex -- it should be personal and most nod to some sort of historical touchstone between the two countries, or the gifter and the receiver. The Trumps came bearing a Tiffany & Co. silver and silk poppy brooch in a custom White House wood jewelry box in a red leather box for Queen Elizabeth II, according to the White House.  For her husband, Prince Philip, they brought a personalized Air Force One jacket and signed autobiography by American General and famed World War II air commander James Doolittle, ""I Could Never Be So Lucky Again.""  Though Prince Philip left active duty naval service when he married then-Princess Elizabeth, he holds a number of military appointments, including as Marshal of the Royal Air Force.  The first lady was ""very involved with the gift selection,"" her spokesperson Stephanie Grisham said.  ""Working with the State Department, Mrs. Trump takes great care in selecting meaningful gifts,"" she added. Likewise, the Trumps were presented with thoughtful gifts of their own in keeping with longstanding tradition.  For the President, the Queen gifted a 1959 first edition copy of Winston Churchill's ""The Second World War"" bound in full crimson goatskin with gold tooling and a three-piece Duofold pen set.  Trump has a known affinity for Churchill; in one of his first notable acts as President, he restored the bust of Winston Churchill, which had been moved during the Obama administration, to the Oval Office. For the first lady, a specially commissioned silver box with a handcrafted enamel lid.  CNN's Max Foster contributed to this report.","Trump, Melania Trump receive a royal gift",Trump and first lady Melania Trump get a gift from the Queen,Melania Trump and Donald Trump: A Day of the People,1,1,7,6,7,4,7,8,6
