"This article originally appeared on Fortune. The New England Patriots’ stunning comeback in Sunday night’s Super Bowl has reminded a lot of people of that other time when things did not go quite as planned: the election of President Donald Trump. History seemed to have repeated itself last night on the playing field, with Atlanta initially holding the strongest chances of winning—but then the game flipped, much like election night when the tables turned against Hillary Clinton as Trump started outperforming in key states like Virginia and Florida.

"N.B.A. Roundup D’Angelo Russell scored 32 points and Rondae Hollis-Jefferson had 18 to lead the host Nets past the Atlanta Hawks, 144-127, on Sunday for their fifth consecutive victory. Joe Harris had 16 points and Spencer Dinwiddie added 15 off the bench for the Nets, who last won five in a row from March 25 to April 2 in 2015. With the win, the Nets continued a series of scoring milestones. ■They had their highest scoring game ever at Barclays Center, topping the 131 they scored against Philadelphia on March 15, 2016. ■The Nets have had at least 70 points in the first half of its last two games, a feat it had not accomplished since the 1983-84 season. The Nets scored 70 points through two quarters against Washington on Friday and had 72 at the half against Atlanta. ■They have scored at least 100 points through the first three quarters in consecutive games for the first time in franchise history. “I think just our commitment for wanting to see each other do better,” said Russell, who finished with seven assists and no turnovers, becoming the first Net with that line since Vince Carter on March 19, 2008, against the Hawks. Russell added that “everybody is aggressive at the appropriate time but still wanting to make that extra pass for the next guy, still having your teammates’ back on the defensive end, that rotation.” Atlanta cut its 21-point deficit to 66-64 when Kent Bazemore capped a 6-0 run with two free throws late in the first half. But the Nets, who finished with a season-high 12 steals, pulled away in the third quarter with an 11-5 run to make it 108-82. John Collins scored 29 points and Dewayne Dedmon had 24 points and 12 rebounds for the Hawks, who have lost three straight and seven of their last eight. It was a bittersweet return for the former Nets guard Jeremy Lin, who said that he wished things had ended differently. Lin said he was surprised and upset with the trade that sent him to Atlanta on July 12 after two years and just 37 games in Brooklyn because of injuries. “Honestly, coming in the building, just thankful,” said Lin, who was averaging 10.8 points and 41 percent shooting from the 3-point line in 25 games. He had six points in 13 minutes on Sunday. “As sad as it is when I think of Brooklyn, obviously, I just think of a lot of injuries and things like that. It’s quite a contrast to being healthy, being able to participate in a game.” PACERS 110, KNICKS 99 Victor Oladipo scored 26 points, Myles Turner had 24 and Indiana beat the visiting Knicks for their seventh straight victory. Oladipo added eight rebounds and seven assists, and Turner finished with six rebounds and two blocks. He also halted the Knicks’ momentum on a fast break in the fourth quarter, sprinting across the court to disrupt Emmanuel Mudiay’s layup attempt that would have cut the Pacers’ lead to four points late in the game. Enes Kanter finished with 20 points and 15 rebounds for the Knicks. It was his 20th double-double of the season.

"In many places, choosing a public school is straightforward: Students go to school based on where they live. In New York City, with its myriad options and variety of admission methods, the process is more complicated, and many students attend school far from home. In an effort to make the admissions process more transparent, a city councilman is expected to introduce a bill on Wednesday that would require the Education Department to release additional data such as the number of applications each school receives, how many offers it extends and where students live. The department already releases information on school capacity, with yearly updates on whether schools have too many students or too few. But this bill goes further, requiring residency information and public reporting on the application process for every school, from kindergarten through high school. It will be introduced by Ben Kallos, a Democrat who represents the Upper East Side, East Midtown and Roosevelt Island. Mr. Kallos said the bill may also include prekindergarten. “It’s important that the public school system serve every single child, and when you only track enrollment, you are missing all the children who are being turned away,” he said. “If we have programs that are incredibly popular, the city should be making more seats available in those programs.” Mr. Kallos said that his constituents routinely complain of being turned away from nearby prekindergarten classrooms or gifted and talented programs, for which they have qualified, because there is not enough room. This legislation would show where students end up when they leave their neighborhoods to attend school, as many do. Mr. Kallos said that most elementary schools in his district were populated with students from the area, but at Ella Baker School, at 317 East 67th Street, which serves students from prekindergarten through eighth grade, most of the students are from elsewhere. Daniel Dromm, a Democrat who represents the Elmhurst and Jackson Heights sections of Queens, is the chairman of the council’s education committee. Mr. Dromm said residential data could help inform policies to increase diversity in the New York City school system. Many neighborhoods are segregated by race and by economic class, and that segregation affects the schools. “This is particularly important in the era of choice, that we have this type of transparency, so we have a better feel of how many students are applying to which schools,” he said. The bill will be discussed Tuesday at an education committee hearing on school construction and how the city decides where to open schools and add seats. A spokeswoman said the Education Department was reviewing the legislation.",New York City Bill Would Require More Data on Admissions,New York City Bill Would Require More Information on School Admissions,New York City Is Trying to Make the Admissions Process More Transparency,10,10,10,6,8,10,9,9,7
"Washington (CNN)The Senate confirmed Andrew Wheeler, a former coal industry lobbyist, to lead the Environmental Protection Agency, in a 52-47 vote Thursday primarily along party lines. Wheeler, also a former Republican Senate aide on environmental issues, has been acting administrator since July, when former EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt resigned amid a host of ethics controversies.  Since Wheeler began leading the agency, he has continued work on many of the same priorities as his predecessor, including looking to roll back Obama-era air and water pollution regulations. But Wheeler has brought a level of stability to the agency that didn't exist under Pruitt, keeping a relatively low profile while continuing to make progress towards meeting the Trump administration's policy goals for the agency. He has met often with industry representatives. Wheeler attended or held more than 50 meetings with representatives of companies or industry groups regulated by the EPA between April and August of 2018, a CNN review of his internal schedules found.  Before Wheeler's confirmation last year as second in command at the EPA, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said Wheeler's qualifications for the job were ""beyond question."" ""Mr. Wheeler's former boss, our colleague Senator (James) Inhofe, says, quote, 'there is no one more qualified.' Our former colleague Senator (Joe) Lieberman has called Mr. Wheeler 'fair and professional,'"" McConnell said. Wheeler has support among most Republicans, but GOP Sen. Susan Collins voted ""no"" on Thursday. In a statement this week, Collins said she believes Wheeler, ""unlike Scott Pruitt, understands the mission of the EPA and acts in accordance with ethical standards; however, the policies he has supported as acting administrator are not in the best interest of our environment and public health.""  She cited Wheeler's policies to roll back environmental protections, including determining that it was no longer necessary to regulate mercury emissions from power plants as an issue for her home state of Maine, which is ""on the receiving end of pollution generated by coal-fired power plants in other states."" While Wheeler doesn't outright deny climate change, he has also downplayed its urgency during his time in the Trump administration.  At Wheeler's confirmation hearing last month, he said he considers climate change an ""eight or nine"" on a 1-to-10 scale of concern but that it is not the greatest crisis. ""I would not call it the greatest crisis,"" he said. ""I consider it a huge issue that has to be addressed globally."" He also said during his hearing that he was still reviewing the major climate change report his agency and others released nearly two months ago. ""I don't disagree with the findings,"" he told senators. ""I'm still examining the findings. I'm trying to understand what was in it and what was covered by the assessment.""

"Washington (CNN)A new Pentagon report concludes that North Korea ""is committed to developing a long-range, nuclear-armed missile that is capable of posing a direct threat to the United States."" The report, required by law, updates Congress regularly on the status of and changes in North Korea's military capabilities. While the report, released Friday, was written prior to Pyongyang's recent nuclear test and satellite launch, it underscores the regime's devotion of large amounts of funding to modernizing its military forces and weapons arsenals. The report also singles out North Korea's Special Operations forces. It calls them ""among the most highly trained, well-equipped, best fed and highly motivated"" forces in North Korean leader Kim Jung Un's military. In other sections of the report, the Pentagon notes North Korea's major Special Operations units ""appear designed for rapid offensive operations,"" including internal defense against foreign attacks. Kim continues to make public statements detailing his views that the country could come under attack, so this assessment appears to square with his priorities. North Korea's Special Operations forces ""operate in specialized units, including reconnaissance, airborne and seaborne insertion, commandos and other specialties,"" the report finds. RELATED: Senate approved new North Korea sanctions  Defense Secretary Ash Carter discussed concerns about North Korea's military last week in Washington. ""Every single day we are watching that DMZ,"" he said, referring to the demilitarized zone between North and South Korea. There are about 27,000 U.S. troops stationed in South Korea. In recent testimony to Congress, CIA Director John Brennan referred to Kim's interested in demonstrating his nuclear and intercontinental ballistic missile capacity to the world. ""He wants to showcase (this capacity) as a way to demonstrate his strength, but also as a way to help to market some of his proliferation capabilities,"" he said. The U.S. worries that North Korea will be able to eventually put a nuclear warhead on a long-range missile. ""The assessment, at least from my perspective, is that he has developed both the nuclear capability as well as developing this ballistic missile capability, marrying them together so that he can demonstrate that he has reached far beyond the Korean Peninsula,"" Brennan told Congress. The report also notes that North Korea continues to work on a long-range missile, called the KN-08, that could give North Korea the ability to attack the U.S. with a mobile launcher that U.S. satellites could have trouble tracking.

"DeepMind, Alphabet's artificial intelligence development wing, published its third research paper in Nature on Wednesday, and it's a doozy: the team invented a new kind of AI that actually learns how to use its own memory. They call it a ""Differential Neural Computer,"" or DNC for short. But what does it even mean for a computer to ""learn"" how to use its memory banks, and why should anyone care? Well, for one, it could help AI to become more powerful and useful than ever before—say, to help you navigate a complex commute in a new city with minimal hassle. The first thing to know is that deep learning, a highly advanced form of machine learning, is made up of a ""neural network""—an interconnected network of ""nodes"" that all run semi-random computations on input data. Neural networks keep doing this over and over, rearranging themselves along the way, until they can reliably produce an accurate result. This is called training. Read More: When AI Goes Wrong, We Won't Be Able to Ask It Why So far, this approach has had some incredible successes. Deep learning was the technique that allowed DeepMind's AlphaGo computer to defeat world Go champion Lee Sedol at his own game. But a major drawback is that neural networks can't learn how to do a second task without rewriting themselves and forgetting how to do the first one. This is called ""catastrophic forgetting."" The computer you're using to read this article doesn't have that problem, because it has an external memory that it can write, rewrite, and recall from. DeepMind's DNCs bridges this gap. Basically, they gave a neural network an external memory unit, and it taught itself how to use it from scratch through the same trial-and-error process that regular neural networks use. The DeepMind team put it like this in a blog post on their site: ""When a DNC produces an answer, we compare the answer to a desired correct answer,"" the post states. ""Over time, the controller learns to produce answers that are closer and closer to the correct answer. In the process, it figures out how to use its memory."" The results are impressive. After feeding the entire subway network of London, England into one of these DNCs, the computer was able to answer complex questions that required a bit of what we might describe as deductive reasoning. For example, here's one question the DNC could answer: ""Starting at Bond street, and taking the Central line in a direction one stop, the Circle line in a direction for four stops, and the Jubilee line in a direction for two stops, at what stop do you wind up?"" Just try asking Siri something that complicated. Chances are it'll end up telling you when the next Bond movie is slated for release. The cherry on top of this sort of powerful problem-solving, the DeepMind team stated, is that DNCs are able to store learned facts and techniques and then call upon them when needed. As with any work on AI at this early stage, it's just one step towards machines that can be useful in our daily lives. But it's a hell of a step.

"Shaquille O'Neal has had one hell of a career. Sure, he's played professionally for six NBA teams, won the finals four times, and become a big-name sportscasting personality. But he's also starred as a rhyming genie in Kazaam, rapped in Aaron Carter's smash hit ""How I Beat Shaq,"" conducted the Boston Pops at Symphony Hall, earned the nickname ""Diesel"" at a mixed-martial arts gym, gone platinum with a debut album in 1993, and served as the global spokesman for Krispy Kreme.

He told the station he hopes to run in 2020, though—as a resident of counties in both Georgia and Florida—he hasn't quite decided where. ""This is something I always wanted to do,"" he told the station. ""It's about bringing people closer together. You know, when I was coming up, people loved and respected the police, the deputies.

"As wildfires burn across the tinder-dry Californian landscape, millions of people have had their electricity turned off by a power company that has refused to fix its decrepit, dangerous equipment. The fear and misery caused by this ongoing disaster can't be understated, and we're seeing ripple effects in communications infrastructure, too: at least one website hosted in the affected area went offline. Even if you're outside California, wildfires and power shut-offs there mean you couldn't access this site while it was down, or any others that might be affected now or in the future, either. On Monday, the Sebastopol, California-headquartered O'Reilly Media tweeted that the company is experiencing outages ""because our home offices are in the no-power and evacuation zones in northern California."" On Tuesday morning, the homepage for O'Reilly advised that, ""due to the fires and power outages in California, oreilly.com is unavailable."" At the time of writing, the site is currently online again. O'Reilly Media is a publishing and online learning company that started one of the internet's first websites in the 1990s. None of the navigation features on the company's homepage worked while it was offline, and URLs that would normally resolve to parts of the site—for example, missingmanuals.com—failed. According to a customer service representative who answered the phone on Tuesday morning, a ""large portion"" (but not all) of O'Reilly's websites are hosted at the company's headquarters, which lost power on Saturday night. ""The power has not been restored and the developers are working on any access that was dependent on the HQ access to see if we can move that onto the cloud,"" the representative said, adding that people could log into O'Reilly's online learning portal via learning.oreilly.com/login, which was online while the main site was inaccessible. California hosts more than 200 data centers according to datacentermap.com, including near areas affected by the power shut-offs. Sacramento, which is just a couple hours' drive from Sebastopol and so far in the clear for shut-offs because it's not serviced by PG&E, hosts data centers for CenturyLink, RagingWire, and more. While losing access to a non-essential (in a life-or-death sense) website is far from the most impactful outcome of the current California wildfire season, it's an unsettling reminder that the internet is a physical thing, and it isn't out of the reach of the devastating ripple effects of the anthropogenic climate crisis and corporate negligence.",At least One Website Was Offline While California Fires Were Shut Down,A California Website Is Offline After the Wildfires,"O'Reilly Media Is Offline, but It's Not completely inaccessible",9,7,10,7,5,10,8,7,9

"Durham, New Hampshire (CNN)Hillary Clinton will take a break from campaigning in New Hampshire on Sunday and visit Flint, Michigan, in an effort to highlight to city's water crisis, according to a Clinton aides. Clinton hopes the trip with shine a spotlight on the tainted water crisis plaguing the city, where officials did not properly treat water being pumped into homes, leaving people exposed to lead and other contaminants. Clinton, according to aides, ""intends to use her trip to Flint to urge the Republican-contolled Senate to approve the Senate Democrats' $600 million amendment to help Flint."" The announcement comes on the same day that Senate Democrats blocked an energy bill over funding for Flint. The trip will take Clinton out of New Hampshire days before the state's critical primary. Clinton is losing by upwards of 30 points in most polls, and a CNN/WMUR survey released on Thursday found Vermont Sen. Bernie Sanders beating Clinton 61% to 30%. Her campaign aides not that while she is leaving New Hampshire, she ""will still be campaigning in New Hampshire every day between now and the primary -- including public appearances in the Granite State on Sunday."" Clinton has made Flint a focus of her campaign since the contaminated water issue was discovered, arguing that if the crisis had happened in a rich Detroit suburb, the response would have been faster and more effective. ""I think every single American should be outraged,"" Clinton said last month. ""We've had a city in the United States of America where the population, which is poor in many ways and majority African-American, has been drinking and bathing in lead-contaminated water. And the governor of that state acted as though he didn't really care."" Clinton also dispatched some of her top aides, including Amanda Renteria, her political director, to the city.  In response to her focus on the issue, Flint's mayor endorsed the presidential candidate in January. ""I want Hillary,"" Karen Weaver said on a conference call with reporters. ""We want a friend like Hillary in the White House. We need a fighter we need someone there fighting for the city of Flint."" Sanders has also focused on the Flint water issue, however he went about it differently than Clinton. Shortly after the issue was discovered, Sanders called on Michigan Gov. Rick Snyder to step down over the issue. ""Secretary Clinton was right and what I did, which I think is also right, is demanded the resignation of the governor. A man who acts that irresponsibly should not stay in power,"" Sanders said in January. The focus on Flint will continue next month when Clinton and Sanders meet on March 6 to debate in the city.

"Washington (CNN)President Donald Trump on Friday attempted to undermine the legitimacy and motivation of thousands of demonstrators on Capitol Hill protesting Supreme Court nominee Brett Kavanaugh, saying demonstrations are funded by George Soros, a billionaire financier and liberal donor who is the frequent topic of unsubstantiated right-wing conspiracy theories.  ""The very rude elevator screamers are paid professionals only looking to make Senators look bad. Don't fall for it!"" Trump tweeted Friday morning. ""Also, look at all of the professionally made identical signs. Paid for by Soros and others. These are not signs made in the basement from love! #Troublemakers(.)""  Demonstrators have descended upon the Hill to protest Kavanaugh's nomination and last month, protestors repeatedly interrupted Kavanaugh's confirmation hearing. On Thursday alone, nearly 300 protesters were arrested in the Hart Senate building.  Kavanaugh's nomination was upended after allegations of sexual assault and misconduct emerged in recent weeks. The revelations and subsequent Senate proceedings have stirred a furious political debate and whipped up protests and recriminations and a clash between the mostly male power structure of the Republican Party and the emerging influence of the #MeToo movement. The President's tweet came less than two hours after Senate Judiciary Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, told Fox Business Network that alongside egging on by Democrats, he believes Soros is paying for protestors to disrupt operations on Capitol Hill as senators deliberate their votes on Kavanaugh.  ""Do you believe George Soros is behind all of this, paying these people to get you and your colleagues in elevators or wherever they can get in your face?"" Fox's Maria Bartiromo asked.  Grassley replied: ""I have heard so many people believe that. I tend to believe it. I believe it fits into his attack mode that he has and how he uses his billions and billions of resources."" Conservatives have noted that Ana Maria Archila, one of the two female protesters who made news when they confronted Arizona Republican Sen. Jeff Flake on a Capitol Hill elevator last week, is a co-executive director for the Center for Popular Democracy -- an organization that's received funding from Soros' Open Society groups. However, despite the speculation by Grassley and the President, there is no evidence to suggest Soros' direct funding toward the protests.  One protester from Maine was asked by Yahoo News if he'd been paid to protest by Soros. He said he was not.  ""(I) wish he paid my airfare: $495,"" the protester said.

"Updated, 5:55 p.m. | Less than 48 hours after becoming the presumptive Republican nominee, Donald J. Trump began his Hispanic outreach with … “taco bowls.” Yes, taco bowls. On his social media accounts, including Twitter, Mr. Trump shared on Thursday afternoon a photo of himself eating what he called a taco bowl and offering a thumbs up at his desk in Trump Tower, along with the message: “Happy #CincoDeMayo! The best taco bowls are made in Trump Tower Grill. I love Hispanics!” — Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) May 5, 2016 Hispanics, however, do not yet love Mr. Trump. Mr. Trump has alienated many Hispanic voters with his campaign, which he began with a speech that dubbed some Mexicans as criminals and rapists. His rallies often include rowdy calls to build a large wall at the border with Mexico. Eighty-two percent of Hispanic registered voters view Mr. Trump unfavorably and only 8 percent view him favorably, according to a CBS News poll in April. And Hispanic leaders immediately seized on Mr. Trump’s taco bowl posts as demeaning. “We’re going back to the day when politicians thought all they had to do was eat a taco or wear a sombrero to win our vote,” said Janet Murguía, president of NCLR (also known as the National Council of La Raza), the nation’s largest Latino organization. “Really?

"Editorial When it comes to criminal justice, Attorney General Jeff Sessions is a man out of time — stuck defiantly in the 1980s, when crime in America was high and politicians scrambled to out-tough one another by passing breathtakingly severe sentencing laws. This mind-set was bad enough when Mr. Sessions was a senator from Alabama working to thwart sentencing reforms in Congress. Now that he is the nation’s top law enforcement officer, he’s trying to drag the country backward with him, even as most states are moving toward more enlightened policies. On May 12, Mr. Sessions announced a drastic policy ordering federal prosecutors to pursue the toughest possible charges against crime suspects in all cases, rescinding an Obama administration directive that focused on reducing punishments for low-level, nonviolent offenders, mostly in drug cases, and steering more law-enforcement resources toward the bigger fish. That approach was working: The federal prison population started to drop for the first time in years, even as crime has remained at historic lows. Instead of acknowledging these gains, Mr. Sessions has clung to the familiar myth that longer, harsher sentences reduce crime and increase public safety. The evidence shows the opposite: To bring down recidivism, a punishment’s swiftness and certainty matter far more than its length. Longer sentences may even lead to more reoffending. Mr. Sessions’s outdated ideas have been rebuked across the political spectrum. Eric Holder, the attorney general who issued the Obama-era policy, called the new approach “dumb on crime.” Senator Rand Paul, Republican of Kentucky, pointed out that people of color suffer disproportionately from mandatory-minimum sentences for drug crimes, and said Mr. Sessions’s charging policy “will accentuate the injustice.” A group of 31 current and former state and local prosecutors — not people ordinarily associated with going soft on crime — signed an open letter calling the directive an “unnecessary and unfortunate return” to harmful and discredited practices. Mr. Sessions has taken a sledgehammer to this rare and fragile bipartisanship, at least on the federal level. And while it’s too soon to know how the new policy will affect sentences, prison populations, or recidivism rates, Mr. Sessions’s assertion that the justice system is not harsh enough — however isolated that view — could trickle down and affect justice reform in the states. Fortunately, states have been moving in the other direction, as budget-conscious lawmakers saw what Mr. Sessions has not — that locking up more people for longer periods is hugely expensive with no real public-safety payoff. The states should continue with their effective, evidence-based approaches, and Congress should find a way at last to pass meaningful sentencing reform. Reducing or eliminating many mandatory minimums would be optimal, but at this point most anything would be an improvement. A bipartisan group of senators recently reintroduced the Justice Safety Valve Act, which would give judges more flexibility to impose lighter sentences in certain cases. They were achingly close to passing a similar bill last year, until a small clot of senators blocked it. One of those senators was Jeff Sessions.",Opinion | Jeff Sessions’s New Sentencing Policy Is a Big Bad,Opinion | Jeff Sessions’s New Sentencing Policy Is a Bad Idea,Opinion | Jeff Sessions Is a Man Out of Time,10,10,10,10,10,8,6,10,9
"Perfume is ubiquitous in Grasse, a medieval town in the south of France that produces many of the flowers used to concoct the earliest fragrances. As demonstrated by the three books below, the industry has inspired much analysis, and these writers offer readers insight into the back-room deals, ingredients and people involved. PERFUMES The A-Z Guide By Luca Turin and Tania Sanchez 400 pp. Viking (2008). If you are looking for your next perfume, you might turn to this useful guide by Luca Turin, who has been called the “emperor of scent,” and Tania Sanchez. In “Perfumes,” they categorize scents into groups such as “best citrus” and “best bang for the buck.” They also give a glossary of ingredients and explain their methodology for critiquing scents. It is an essential road map for consumers or perfume aficionados. THE PERFECT SCENTA Year Inside the Perfume Industry in Paris and New YorkBy Chandler Burr340 pp. Henry Holt and Co. (2008). In this insider account of the creation of two perfumes — Hermès’s Jardin sur le Nil and Coty’s Lovely by Sarah Jessica Parker — Chandler Burr, the former perfume critic for The New York Times, gives unfettered access to his world. Burr offers insights into his journalistic process, including how he arranges anonymous sources and his conversations with key players, as well as plenty of behind-the-scenes information about the industry, which he writes is “as obsessed with the best-seller lineup as Hollywood is with the international box-office scores.” By juxtaposing the stories of the two perfumes with that of the corporate giant Coty Inc., he paints an informative portrait of the multibillion-dollar business. THE SECRET OF CHANEL NO. 5The Intimate History of the World’s Most Famous PerfumeBy Tilar J. Mazzeo281 pp. Harper/HarperCollins Publishers (2011). This book looks at the life of Coco Chanel as seen through the creation and success of her best-selling signature scent, referred to as “the monster” by industry insiders because of its unprecedented success. Chanel introduced Chanel No. 5, which smells of jasmine flowers and roses from Grasse, at a dinner party in 1921. She sprayed the perfume in the air around her and kept quiet as all the women sniffed the air, wondering about the source of the intoxicating smell. Chanel “pretended not to notice.” The author recounts how the fragrance came to be and how, though Chanel would later broker a more advantageous deal, she lost her business to Pierre and Paul Wertheimer, the two brothers who handled the iconic scent’s manufacturing and distribution.",3 New Books in the Perfume Industry,Perfume in Grasse: Three Books,How to Buy a Perfume in Grasse,8,9,6,7,9,5,5,9,5
"Washington (CNN)The Department of Homeland Security stood by the decision to end the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program last September in a court filing Friday evening -- setting up a potential court duel over the future of the program this summer.   In the filing, Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen said she stands by the department's legal reasoning behind the decision to end DACA last September and reiterated that the government believes it has the authority to do so. In a related filing in a separate appellate court Friday night, the government asked a panel of judges to reverse a previous judge's order to reopen the program to renewals.    The memo was requested by a federal judge who ordered that the program be reinstated in full but gave the Trump administration 90 days to better explain its decision to end DACA -- a program that had protected nearly 800,000 young undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children from deportation.  The Trump administration announced the termination of DACA last year, saying it believed the courts would overturn the program under a legal challenge to it, but initially called on Congress to act.  Friday's filing largely reiterates the same legal arguments the judge found insufficient in the administration's prior attempt, adding that because the program itself was designed as a discretionary exercise of immigration enforcement, the administration likewise has the discretion to end the program and resume that enforcement. The filing tees up a potential order to reinstate DACA. The filing also said the Justice Department intends to continue to pursue an appeal to any court order that would restore DACA in full, and almost simultaneously the administration filed a request in its separate case before the 9th US Circuit Court of Appeals to reverse a California federal judge's order to reopen DACA to renewals. That case has already been argued in court and is awaiting the appellate panel's decision.   ""The Justice Department continues to maintain that the Department Homeland Security acted well within its lawful authority to rescind DACA in an orderly manner, and today's memo responds to a court order by providing further explanation of why the decision to rescind DACA was, and remains, entirely proper,"" a Justice Department spokesperson said in a statement. ""Promoting and enforcing the rule of law is vital to protecting a nation, its borders and its citizens. The Justice Department will continue to vigorously defend this position."" Though DACA renewals have already resumed under previous court orders, Judge John Bates' decision would order that DACA be restored not only in the form of renewal applications, as it is currently, but also in total -- meaning new people would be able to apply. In April, Bates was the third judge to say the Trump administration had failed to adequately justify its decision to end DACA.  The filing on Friday comes as a judge in Texas is considering a request by a handful of red states to completely overturn DACA as unconstitutional. He is widely expected to rule that way, setting up potentially conflicting judicial orders and paving the way for a Supreme Court showdown. CNN reported in April that Bates was heavily skeptical in his decision of the administration's reasoning that a threat to sue the DACA program brought by Texas and a handful of other states -- which eventually came to fruition this spring as the program was reopened -- meant it was likely a court would immediately throw out DACA entirely.

"A spectator’s view of the celebration on the National Mall. Mr. Winter is a staff photographer currently on assignment for Opinion. For the first time since Richard Nixon’s “Honor America Day” (which was unceremoniously and prematurely ended by nude protesters and widespread violence), a president inserted himself into what has traditionally been a nonpartisan celebration of the nation’s birthday. This year’s “Salute to America” wasn’t met with violence or nudity. It was well attended, with visitors from across red America traveling to see President Trump, flanked by armored vehicles, extol the virtues of the American military branches past, present and future (including the “Space Force”) as he summoned machines of war from the sky. But what those visitors saw were fences, lots and lots of fences. The throngs of the MAGA-hatted not lucky enough to have V.I.P. tickets were met with a wall, cutting right through the middle of the Reflecting Pool and separating the Very Important People from the somewhat less important people. I met families from Jackson, Miss., and Orlando, Fla., to Fond du Lac, Wis, who braved the hot and soggy conditions for upward of six hours, waited in long lines with their young children, and with other families pressed against this border for a glimpse of their president on giant television screens obscuring the solemn grandeur of the Lincoln Memorial. During the president’s speech, children played, people snacked and attentions drifted as his voice echoed indistinctly across the expanse. It wasn’t his usual rally speech; there was no finger-pointing or blame-assigning. Without the usual playbook, it was harder for him to pump up his audience. But the visitors were in awe of the flyovers that punctuated the speech every few minutes and almost everyone made it through to the end to watch the fireworks. After the rain cleared and night fell, the air was damp and still. The first few barrages of fireworks filled the sky with thick grey smoke, obscuring the view. From where I stood, with the families from Florida, Mississippi, Wisconsin and elsewhere, the sky throbbed with indistinct pulses of color, casting a glow over the nation’s most enduring symbol of unity.

"Ask Real Estate Guaranteeing a friend’s lease is a generous thing to do — you just may be responsible for the rent for decades. Q: About 20 years ago, as a favor to a friend, I signed on as the guarantor for his lease on a rental apartment in the Village. He still lives there, and has presumably renewed the lease annually; we never discussed it. Our friendship has recently ended, and since he has been unemployed for over 18 months, I am concerned that he may soon be unable to pay his rent. I no longer have a copy of the lease, and he will not provide me with one. I’m not sure if my name is still on the lease, but if it is, I’d like to remove myself as the guarantor. How do I do that? A: Sign a lease as a guarantor and you are just as responsible for the rent as the tenant living in the apartment. In some leases, the guarantor is only named for the initial term. In others, the guarantor remains on the lease with each renewal, in which case you would still be responsible all these years later. If the tenant fails to pay the rent, the landlord could sue you for it. So you need to see a copy of the lease. If your former friend won’t show it to you, contact the managing agent or the landlord and explain that you were the guarantor for a lease signed two decades ago and would like to review it. If you don’t know who owns or manages the property, look up the building’s address on ACRIS, the city’s property-record portal, or walk past it and see if the managing agent’s name is on a placard. A super or doorman could also tell you whom to contact. If you are still named, ask the landlord to terminate your guarantee. This may take some negotiation, and you might have to divulge your concerns about your former friend to protect your financial interests. Unfortunately, your leverage will be limited. The best option would be to tell the landlord that you are unable or refuse to stand behind the tenant’s obligation. “This could make the landlord concerned and look to either demand that the tenant find a new guarantor or refuse to renew the tenant’s lease,” if the apartment is market rate, said Sherwin Belkin, a lawyer who represents landlords and a partner at the New York City firm Belkin Burden Wenig & Goldman. Before you expose your former friend’s financial instability, effectively putting him in danger of losing his apartment, you can give him one more chance to show you the lease. If he refuses, you’ll have no choice but to involve the landlord. And even if he does show it to you, you may still be on the hook for thousands of dollars.

"Sinosphere BEIJING — China’s leaders thought they had a solution to the torrent of snark, jibes and condemnation on Twitter: They banned access to it at home. Yet China has become the country that President-elect Donald J. Trump seems to enjoy criticizing the most on his open-all-hours Twitter feed. In bursts of 140 characters or less, he has jabbed at Beijing over Taiwan, trade, the South China Sea and, most recently, North Korea. “China has been taking out massive amounts of money & wealth from the U.S. in totally one-sided trade, but won’t help with North Korea. Nice!” Mr. Trump said on Twitter on Monday. How and when President Xi Jinping reads about these broadsides remains a mystery to outsiders. Translating Mr. Trump’s sarcasm — “Nice!” — could be tricky. But Chinese officials and the state news media want Mr. Trump to know that their leaders prefer doing diplomacy the old-fashioned way, behind closed doors and muffled in platitudes. Xinhua, the state news agency, has more or less asked Mr. Trump to shut up. “An obsession with ‘Twitter foreign policy’ is undesirable,” read the headline of a Xinhua commentary on Tuesday about Mr. Trump’s posts. “Everyone recognizes the common sense that foreign policy isn’t child’s play, and even less is it like doing business deals,” said the article, published after Mr. Trump’s latest barbed comments on China. “Twitter shouldn’t become an instrument of foreign policy,” the article said. Earlier that day, a spokesman for the Ministry of Foreign Affairs rejected Mr. Trump’s accusation that Beijing had coddled North Korea. But the article acknowledged that it was probably too late to detach Mr. Trump from Twitter. Mr. Trump’s designated press secretary, Sean Spicer, has indicated that Mr. Trump will keep using the terse, punchy format after he settles in the White House. “Issuing tweets has become a habit for Mr. Trump,” Xinhua noted. Mr. Trump, it said, appeared to assume that “issuing hard-line comments and taking up sensitive issues may perhaps add to his chips for negotiating with other countries.” Mr. Xi is most unlikely to joust directly with Mr. Trump on Twitter. The service has been banned in China since 2009, though residents find ways to poke through the firewall of censorship. And while Chinese politicians love slogans, they prefer to communicate with foreign leaders through long, tranquilizing disquisitions. Open sarcasm is rare.

"In Debt This week, President Trump, in signing another in a seemingly endless parade of executive orders, vowed to “do a big number” on Dodd-Frank, the 2010 law enacted in response to the financial crisis. While doing so will require more than a presidential signature on a piece of paper, and we have yet to see what sort of working relationship the president will have with Congress, I take him at his word. So far, he seems quite determined to do exactly what he said he was going to do during the election campaign. I also think the effort to dismantle Dodd-Frank will start in earnest with the Orderly Liquidation Authority. This is the special bankruptcy procedure for large financial institutions. It was enacted to allow the “too big to fail” banks an avenue to do the latter, since they are still quite big. Other commentators have pointed to the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau or the Volcker Rule, which restricts banks from making some of the speculative investments that led to the 2008-9 global economic crisis, as likely first targets. But the consumer bureau has strong defenders, including a United States senator, and dismantling Volcker would have really bad optics. The banks have already figured out several ways around the Volcker Rule — consider trading in distressed syndicated loans — and they may decide it is not worth the negative publicity that repeal would entail. But who is going to stand up for an obscure piece of insolvency law that is easily painted as a bailout tool? Moreover, because the Orderly Liquidation Authority includes a line of credit for the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation when it conducts liquidations under the law, any changes to this provision of Dodd-Frank, known as Title II, can happen through the budget reconciliation process, which is entirely immune from filibusters. And once Title II is gone, other pieces of Dodd-Frank may follow. Many of the proposals to create a new part of the bankruptcy code for banks — including that embedded in Representative Jeb Hensarling’s proposed Financial Choice Act — are pretend solutions. The proposals provide no real way to deal with anything beyond a very stylized form of bank failure. If the bank fails in any way other than as predicted — and who exactly predicted the failure of Lehman Brothers or the near-collapse of the American International Group? — these proposals will be useless. That, of course, will lead to a plea from Wall Street for bailouts. If that happens during a Trump administration, it will be interesting to see what happens next. On the one hand, I doubt the president’s core supporters would be too keen on seeing their tax dollars flow again to Wall Street. On the other hand, as Lehman showed, financial panics cause mass financial destruction, even when we engage in some degree of bailouts. It is beyond doubt that without government assistance to both the banks and the automakers, 2008-09 would have been far worse for the average Trump voter.",Trump’s Plan to Repeal Dodd-Frank Will Be a Bailout,Trump’s Plan to Destroy Dodd-Frank Is a Big Number,Opinion | Trump’s Biggest Executive Order of the Year,7,9,9,8,8,9,6,9,10
"Todd R. Howe, the federal government’s disgraced star witness who was arrested midway through his testimony in a recent Albany corruption trial, will not be called to testify in a second such trial scheduled to begin in two weeks, prosecutors disclosed on Tuesday. Although the prosecutors did not state a reason, there seemed to be little doubt that they had calculated that any benefit his testimony could provide in the trial might be outweighed by the potential harm it could cause. Mr. Howe, a former lobbyist in Albany and Washington who had worked for Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo when Mr. Cuomo served as secretary of the Department of Housing and Urban Development during the Clinton administration, had already pleaded guilty to eight felonies, and was cooperating with prosecutors in the trial of Joseph Percoco, a former top aide to Mr. Cuomo. Mr. Howe’s arrest in February came after he admitted on cross-examination during Mr. Percoco’s trial that he had attempted to defraud a credit card company — in violation of his cooperation deal with the government, which included a provision that he “commit no further crimes whatsoever.” Mr. Percoco was nonetheless convicted in March. The forthcoming trial involves allegations of bid-rigging in Mr. Cuomo’s signature upstate economic development plan, known as the Buffalo Billion. Mr. Howe was expected to testify for the government against the five defendants, including Alain E. Kaloyeros, the former president of the State University’s Polytechnic Institute and also a former ally of Governor Cuomo’s. The five defendants have pleaded not guilty. The government has accused Dr. Kaloyeros of steering state contracts to COR Development, a Syracuse-area firm, and to LPCiminelli, a Buffalo developer, each of which had made “sizable contributions to the governor’s re-election campaign,” the indictment says. A sixth defendant, Kevin Schuler, an executive with LPCiminelli, pleaded guilty on May 18 and said in court that he had agreed to cooperate with prosecutors. At Mr. Percoco’s trial, Mr. Howe testified about a life of lies and unsavory business dealings, but it was only under a withering cross-examination that he admitted to attempting to defraud his credit card company. After the hearing on Tuesday, Paul Shechtman, a lawyer for one of the defendants, Louis Ciminelli, the founder of LPCiminelli, said, “I’m proud that the U.S. attorney’s office has concluded, albeit belatedly, that Todd Howe is not worthy of belief.” A spokesman for the United States attorney’s office in Manhattan declined to comment after the hearing.

"A state-backed Chinese brewer has agreed to buy out SABMiller’s stake in the maker of Snow, the world’s best-selling beer, Anheuser-Busch InBev said on Tuesday. Anheuser-Busch InBev is hoping the sale to China Resources Beer will help to ease regulators’ concerns about its nearly $104 billion merger with SABMiller, which owns a 49 percent stake in CR Snow. The deal would value SABMiller’s stake at about $1.6 billion. Since their deal was announced last year, the two brewers have worked to win over regulators. The transaction would give the Chinese business full ownership of a beer brand that outsells better-known lines like Bud Light. “This agreement is subject to any applicable regulatory approval in China, and AB InBev and CRB will work closely together through any such process,” Anheuser Busch InBev said in a news release. The sale of SABMiller’s stake in the joint venture in China had been anticipated by analysts since the Anheuser-Busch InBev deal was announced, and is one of several transactions being undertaken in order to appease regulators. The combination of Anheuser-Busch InBev and SABMiller would create a beer industry giant that would have annual revenue of about $64 billion and that would account for about 30 percent of global beer sales. In November, SABMiller agreed to sell its 59 percent stake in MillerCoors in the United States to its joint venture partner Molson Coors Brewing for about $12 billion. That deal includes the global rights to the Miller brand and would make Molson Coors the second-largest brewer in the United States, behind Anheuser-Busch InBev. In February, Asahi Group Holdings of Japan agreed to a binding offer to buy the beer brands Peroni and Grolsch, as well as certain European operations of SABMiller, for 2.55 billion euros, or about $2.8 billion. The Molson Coors, Asahi and Snow transactions are all contingent on the SABMiller-Anheuser Busch InBev merger closing. The Snow transaction has been approved by the board of China Resources Beer, as well as by its majority shareholder. After the deal’s closing, CR Snow will become a direct wholly owned subsidiary of China Resources Beer.

"Washington (CNN)The embattled nominee tapped to lead the Department of Veterans Affairs was known as ""the candy man"" inside the White House, Sen. Jon Tester said Tuesday, citing reports from individuals who raised concerns about his nomination.  The Montana Democrat told CNN's Anderson Cooper that around 20 people raised concerns to his committee about Rear Adm. Ronny Jackson, and according to those people, Jackson would hand out prescriptions ""like candy.""  Tester described reports to the Veterans' Affairs Committee that alleged that on overseas trips, Jackson would ""go down the aisle way of the airplane and say, 'All right, who wants to go to sleep?' And hand out the prescription drugs like they were candy ... and put them to sleep and then give them the drugs to wake them back up again.""  Tester's staff told CNN that Jackson would hand out Ambien and Provigil.  ""These are called controlled substances for a reason,"" Tester said on ""Anderson Cooper 360.""  Jackson's nomination came following the removal of David Shulkin from heading the VA, but his confirmation is in jeopardy as Democrats and Republicans on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee review allegations against him. CNN previously reported that Jackson met with President Donald Trump on Tuesday amid the tumult with his nomination. After the meeting, the White House began publicly defending Jackson.  However, the White House doctor also faces allegations of being drunk while overseas with then-President Barack Obama.  ""If you are drunk and something happens with the President, it's very difficult to go in and treat the President,"" Tester said. ""That's what multiple people told us, this was the case on several different trips."" Tester said there had been comments that Jackson would not be able to respond ""because he had been drinking so much.""  CNN reported Tuesday that on an overseas trip in 2015, Jackson was intoxicated and banged on the hotel room door of a female employee, according to four sources familiar with the allegation. The incident became so noisy, one source familiar with the allegation told CNN, that the Secret Service stopped Jackson out of concern that he would wake Obama. Other concerns about Jackson included allegations of a toxic work environment, Tester confirmed. ""We were told time and time again the people above him he treated like gold, the people below him, he belittled, screamed at them, really created a very toxic environment to the point where the people who worked around him felt like they had to walk on eggshells because of his lack of respect for his job,"" Tester said.  Jackson's hearing will be delayed indefinitely following the allegations, lawmakers leading the confirmation announced Tuesday morning.  CNN's Juana Summers, Phil Mattingly, Manu Raju, Jeff Zeleny, Kevin Liptak, Kaitlan Collins and Pamela Brown contributed to this report.

"“Death of the Liberal Class,” a muddle of a play by Robert Lyons at the New Ohio Theater, tries to find bigger themes in a male schlub’s midlife crisis. But that’s asking too much of the story’s irksome, inconsistent characters. The play takes its title from a 2010 book by Chris Hedges, a former war correspondent for The New York Times, who in it excoriated the institutions of liberalism for allowing capitalism to run amok. (“Pessimism porn,” The Huffington Post called the book in a review.) Mr. Lyons’s play, though, isn’t really about the book; it’s an imagining of what might happen to an author who wrote such a book and then decided to stop fighting the polemic fight. In Mr. Lyons’s story that man is Nick (Steven Rattazzi), who has withdrawn with his teenage daughter, Andrea (Jeanette Diloné), to a farm in Canada. Partly this is so he and his wife, Daphne (Melissa Murray), can ponder divorce, but mostly it’s to escape the noise he has helped generate with his screed. “You used to be so angry about everything,” Andrea says, wishing he still were. He replies, “I guess being on this farm makes me less angry and more happy.” His book made at least two converts: Andrea and a hacker she met online (Justin Colón). They have taken Nick’s more radical ideas to heart — a little too enthusiastically, as it turns out. The notion of a younger generation calling out hypocrisy by actually taking the actions an older generation only bloviated about holds some appeal, but the play is more interested in validating several wearying middle-age fantasies. One is that paunchy academics can achieve rock-star-level fame and influence. Another is that young people, if properly indoctrinated, will see the superiority of the music and movies their parents loved. (Nick and Andrea have an annoying habit of communicating in song lyrics by Bob Dylan and such.) Most oppressive of all is that favorite crutch of scripts about pudgy, balding men: Attractive women are eager to jump into bed with them. Here, Nick’s conquests include not only his estranged wife, but also his gorgeous neighbor (Olivia Horton). That might be plausible if Nick were intellectually attractive, but Mr. Rattazzi, under Jerry Heymann’s direction, doesn’t remotely make him so. The character lurches from whiny to irritating to inappropriately wisecracking — Homer Simpson with a think-tank-caliber résumé. Mr. Rattazzi is an experienced actor, but he can’t make this work. It’s telling that the play’s most effective scene is a flashback to when Nick was still on the warpath about liberalism’s failures. That guy might have made for a bracing case study, but once all the bluster has been removed from him, he’s kind of dull. Maybe that’s Mr. Lyons’s point.

"Washington  (CNN)Republican presidential hopeful and former US Rep. Joe Walsh said Monday he regrets falsely claiming former President Barack Obama was Muslim in 2016 tweets.  Walsh insisted ""there was nothing derogatory meant by"" the claim, but told CNN's Erica Hill on ""The Lead"" he apologizes for his comments, saying it was ""wrong."" The former Illinois congressman, who recently announced he will challenge President Donald Trump for the 2020 Republican presidential nomination, accused Obama in 2016 of hating Israel and said the reason was because he is Muslim.  The conservative radio host, who was elected to Congress with support from the Tea Party, was also accused that year of inciting violence against Obama in the wake of a deadly sniper attack on Dallas police. Walsh said earlier Monday he's running against Trump ""to make the moral case against him.""  ""Look, I have been waiting every single day this year for somebody to step up, a Republican to step up, to make the moral case against him. That he is unfit,"" Walsh told CNN's Alisyn Camerota on ""New Day."" ""Come on -- somebody should challenge him.""  On Sunday, Walsh announced he will challenge Trump and told ABC News in an interview that ""the country cannot afford to have him win."" Walsh said he won't vote for the President if Trump again wins the party's nomination.  Walsh, on Monday and in the weeks leading up to his announcement, apologized for what he said was his role in helping elect Trump in 2016 and for how controversial tweets he previously made may have helped ""lead to what we have now in the White House.""  Asked by Camerota about his incendiary tweets, Walsh defended his Twitter habits, saying his ""impulse is to push the envelope and to get people to think."" ""I just want to remind people: even if you don't agree with me, we live in a country where we do have free speech,"" he said, adding, ""Oftentimes, Alisyn, I step over the line ... If there's one thing I've learned in the last couple years (it) is it can lead to what we have in the White House now.""  Walsh also said his radio callers probably do not think he can beat Trump in the primary, but added that his campaign is about being ""brave"" and that his bid is ""a bet I'm making.""  Trump is already facing a Republican primary challenge by former Massachusetts Gov. Bill Weld, who announced in April he was officially entering the race to take on Trump in 2020. The President could also face a challenge from former Rep. Mark Sanford of South Carolina, who is mulling a bid. CNN's Caroline Kelly and Kate Sullivan contributed to this report.

"Tom Price, the secretary of health and human services, said on Saturday that he did not plan to travel on private jets until the department’s inspector general completes a formal review of the use of taxpayer funds for his chartered flights. Mr. Price, a physician and former Republican congressman from Georgia who has advocated cost-cutting at his agency, was sharply criticized by Democrats this week after Politico reported that he had chartered several work-related flights at a steep additional cost to the federal government. In a report published late Saturday afternoon, Politico said it had identified more than $400,000 in spending on private jets for Mr. Price’s travels since May. The report said that taxpayers paid for Mr. Price to take at least 26 flights on private charter planes in that time. In an interview on Fox News on Saturday, Mr. Price acknowledged that “the optics in some of this don’t look good.” Still, he maintained that each chartered trip had been legally reviewed. The secretary said that his department’s inspector general was conducting “a review and an audit” of the approval process, and that he had also initiated a separate “internal departmental review of the procedures.” “We’ve heard this criticism, and we’re very, very serious about addressing it,” Mr. Price told Fox News. He added later: “I don’t think there would be any charter trips until this review is complete. I think that’s appropriate because of the concerns that we’ve heard.” Tesia D. Williams, a spokeswoman for the department’s Office of Inspector General, confirmed late Saturday that the office was reviewing Mr. Price’s use of chartered aircrafts for government travel. The review, she said, began “as soon as questions arose” and “focuses on whether travel complied with federal travel regulations, but may encompass other issues related to travel.” Mr. Price defended the chartered trips as having been “work-related and official business.” He said he had taken 11 such trips over the last eight months, the majority of which he said were connected to the opioid crisis or hurricanes. “We’ve taken many, many trips in cars — sometimes four and five hours at a time,” he said. Earlier this week, a spokeswoman for the Health and Human Services Department cited Mr. Price’s “incredibly demanding schedule” as explanation for his travel choices. But Democrats were quick to point out that previous secretaries flew on commercial airlines even while dealing with grueling schedules; several called for a review by the inspector general, which is now apparently underway. It was not clear exactly how long the review would take, but Mr. Price told Fox News he expected it would be completed “expeditiously.”",Tom Price Says He Won’t Travel on Private Jets Until Review,Tom Price Says He Won’t Travel on Private Jets Until Review Is Complete,Tom Price Says He Won’t Travel on Private Jets Until Inspections Are Completed,10,10,5,9,8,6,9,9,7
